			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaliyah Dana Haughton (January 16, 1979 – August 25, 2001) was an American singer, actress and model. Born in Brooklyn and raised in Detroit, she first gained recognition at the age of 10, when she appeared on the television show Star Search and performed in concert alongside Gladys Knight. At the age of 12, Aaliyah signed with Jive Records and her uncle Barry Hankerson's Blackground Records. Hankerson introduced her to <div class="blackbox">R. Kelly</div>, who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, Age Ain't Nothing but a Number. The album sold three million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After facing allegations of an illegal marriage with <div class="blackbox">R. Kelly</div>, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with Atlantic Records.

				<b><p2>Missy Elliot</p2></b>
			</a>
			for her second album, One in a Million, which sold three million copies in the United States and more than eight million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first film, Romeo Must Die. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single "Try Again". The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 solely on airplay, making Aaliyah the first artist in Billboard history to achieve this goal. After completing Romeo Must Die, Aaliyah filmed her role in Queen of the Damned, and released, in 2001, her self-titled third and final studio album, which topped the Billboard 200.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August 25, 2001, Aaliyah was killed in an airplane accident in the Bahamas, when the badly overloaded aircraft she was travelling in crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all nine on board. The pilot was later found to have traces of cocaine and alcohol in his body, and was not qualified to fly the aircraft designated for the flight. Aaliyah's family later filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the aircraft's operator, Blackhawk International Airways, which was settled out of court.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaliyah's music has continued to achieve commercial success, aided by several posthumous releases, and has sold an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide. Her accolades include three American Music Awards and two MTV VMAs, along with five Grammy Award nominations. She has been credited for helping to redefine contemporary R&B, pop and hip hop, earning her the nicknames the "Princess of R&B" and "Queen of Urban Pop", and influencing numerous artists of different music genres. Billboard lists her as the tenth most successful female R&B artist of the past 25 years, and the 27th most successful in history.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought up playing music in the church, the brothers used the time wisely crafting their skills with different instruments and live performance. Their passion for music continued and Adeaze performed eagerly at various church and school functions, during their adolescent years. The brothers attended Mangere College in Auckland New Zealand. In 1999 the brothers attended Excel School of Performing Arts and received Diplomas in Performance graduating at the top of the class, followed by a national tour of New Zealand with the students of Excel. The same year Adeaze caught the attention of Brotha D from Dawn Raid, who recognising the talent got the duo to record two songs for the upcoming compilation Southside Story (Dawn Raids Debut Album).
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duo released their debut album Always and for Real in 2004, which includes the number-one hit "Getting Stronger", their cover version of

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1964, after his family moved from Arkansas to Michigan, Green and some friends formed the Creations and toured the chitlin circuit (venues that catered to African American audiences) in the South before renaming themselves Al Green and the Soul Mates three years later. They formed their own record label, releasing the single “Back Up Train,” which enjoyed moderate success on the rhythm-and-blues charts in 1968. The watershed moment for Green came in Texas in 1968 when he met Willie Mitchell, a former bandleader who served as chief producer and vice president of Hi Records in Memphis, Tennessee. Obscurity was threatening to end Green’s fledgling career, but with Mitchell’s help he became a star in short order. After releasing a cover version of the Beatles’ “I Want to Hold Your Hand” in 1969, which exhibited his awe-inspiring vocal agility, Green recorded a fine remake of 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-al-green');toggle_visibility('ma-the-temptations');">
				<b><p2>The Temptations’</p2></b>
			</a> “I Can’t Get Next to You,” and it reached number one on the soul charts in 1971. But it was “Tired of Being Alone” (1971), written by Green, that suggested his extraordinary potential. It sold more than a million copies, preparing the way for “Let’s Stay Together,” the title track from Green’s first gold album.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Let’s Stay Together” was his biggest hit, reaching number one on both the rhythm-and-blues and pop charts in 1972. Written by Green, Mitchell, and Al Jackson, the drummer for Booker T. and the MG’s, the song reflected Mitchell’s musical vision. In comparison with the grittier sound of Memphis neighbour Stax/Volt Records, Green’s recordings with Mitchell offered a sophisticated and softened melody cradled by a distinctive bass sound. Green delivered gospel intensity, effortlessly soaring to the highest falsetto or plunging into a husky groan cloaked in hushed sensuality. From the tender “I’m Still in Love with You” (1972) and “Call Me (Come Back Home)” (1973) to the earthy “Love and Happiness” (1973) and “Here I Am (Come and Take Me)” (1973), Green and Mitchell experienced a string of hits through the early 1970s.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-1970s Green became a minister, establishing his own church. By 1980 he had devoted himself completely to his ministry and to gospel music. Later in that decade he cautiously reemerged from his spiritual seclusion and resumed performances of his most celebrated works alongside his popular gospel recordings, several of which won Grammy Awards in the soul gospel category. After a commercially disappointing comeback effort in 1995, Green came close to recapturing his trademark 1970s sound on I Can’t Stop (2003), which he followed with Everything’s OK (2005). Green won a new generation of fans with Lay It Down (2008), featuring guest vocals by neo-soul artists John Legend,

			and Corinne Bailey Rae; the album earned him a pair of Grammy Awards. In 2018 he released a new single for the first time in nearly 10 years, a cover of “Before the Next Teardrop Falls.”

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keys has been referred to as the "Queen of R&B" by various media outlets. Time has listed her in its list of 100 most influential people twice. Journalist Christopher John Farley wrote: "Her musicianship raises her above her peers. She doesn't have to sample music's past like a DJ scratching his way through a record collection; she has the chops to examine it, take it apart and create something new and personal with what she has found" in 2005. In 2017, Kerry Washington also wrote "Songs in A Minor infused the landscape of hip-hop with a classical sensibility and unfolded the complexity of being young, gifted, female and black for a new generation. Alicia became an avatar for millions of people, always remaining true to herself" in 2017. Rolling Stone named Songs in A Minor as one of the "100 Greatest Albums", and its single "Fallin'" in their "100 greatest songs" of the 2000s decade.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keys has cited several artists as her inspirations, including Whitney Houston, John Lennon,

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An accomplished classical pianist, Keys incorporates piano into a majority of her songs. Keys was described by New York Daily News as "one of the most versatile musicians of her generation". Keys' music is influenced by vintage soul music rooted in gospel, while she heavily incorporates classical piano with R&B, jazz, blues and hip hop into her music. The Guardian noted that Keys is skilled at fusing the "ruff hip-hop rhythms she absorbed during her New York youth" into her "heartfelt, soulful R&B stylings". The Songwriters Hall of Fame stated that Keys broke onto the music scene with "her unmistakable blend of soul, hip-hop, jazz and classical music". She began experimenting with other genres, including pop and rock, in her third studio album, As I Am, transitioning from neo soul to a 1980s and 1990s R&B sound with her fourth album, The Element of Freedom. 
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, The Independent described her musical style as consisting of "crawling blues coupled with a hip-hop backbeat, and soul melodies enhanced with her raw vocals". The New York Daily News stated that her incorporation of classical piano riffs contributed to her breakout success. Jet magazine stated she "thrives" by touching fans with "piano mastery, words and melodious voice". In 2002, The New York Times wrote that on stage Keys "invariably starts with a little Beethoven" and "moves into rhythm-and-blues that's accessorized with hip-hop scratching, jazz scat-singing and glimmers of gospel." Keys's debut album, PopMatters wrote, reflects her sensibilities as young woman and as a "musical, cultural, and racial hybrid." NPR stated in 2016 that Keys' overall work consists of notable "diversity to style and form". Salon wrote that the diversity of Keys' music is "representative of her own border-breaking background and also emblematic of the variety responsible for the excitement and energy of American culture."

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bee Gees have sold over 120 million records worldwide (with estimates as high as over 220 million), making them among the best-selling music artists of all time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997; the presenter of the award to "Britain's first family of harmony" was Brian Wilson, historical frontman of the Beach Boys, another "family act" featuring three harmonising brothers.

You've got to remember, we were fairly dead in the water at that point, 1975, somewhere in that zone—the Bee Gees' sound was basically tired. We needed something new. We hadn't had a hit record in about three years. So we felt, Oh Jeez, that's it. That's our life span, like most groups in the late '60s. So, we had to find something. We didn't know what was going to happen.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill Oakes, who supervised the soundtrack, asserts that Saturday Night Fever did not begin the disco craze but rather prolonged it: "Disco had run its course. These days, Fever is credited with kicking off the whole disco thing—it really didn't. Truth is, it breathed new life into a genre that was actually dying."

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell is an American singer-songwriter. She first gained attention in 2015 when she uploaded the song "Ocean Eyes" to SoundCloud, which was subsequently released by the Interscope Records subsidiary Darkroom. The song was written and produced by her brother Finneas, with whom she collaborates on music and live shows. Her debut EP, Don't Smile at Me (2017), became a sleeper hit, reaching the top 15 in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eilish's debut studio album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? (2019), debuted atop the Billboard 200 and became the best-performing album of 2019 in the US. It also reached number one in the UK. The album contains six Billboard Hot 100 top 40 songs: "When the Party's Over", "Bury a Friend", "Wish You Were Gay", "Xanny" and "Bad Guy", the last of which became her first number one single in the US. In 2020, she performed the theme song "No Time to Die" for the James Bond film of the same name, which became her first to peak at number one in the UK.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her accolades include five Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards, two Guinness World Records, three MTV Video Music Awards, and one Brit Award. She is the youngest person and second person ever to win the four main Grammy categories – Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Album of the Year – in the same year.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, their first single "Baby Be Mine" was released on the soundtrack to the Universal Pictures comedy CB4 (starring Chris Rock). The song was written by Riley and Stonestreet and produced by Riley.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their debut album, Blackstreet, featured the singles "Booti Call", "Before I Let You Go" and "Joy". "Booti Call" and "Before I Let You Go" were both Top 40 hits, with "Before I Let You Go" hitting the Top 10. In 1996, they released their sophomore album Another Level. It was a breakthrough success due to the top single "No Diggity" (with 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-blackstreet');toggle_visibility('ma-dr-dre');">
				<b><p2>Dr. Dre),</p2></b>
			</a> which was a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in November 1996. In 1998, Blackstreet won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Level eventually went four times platinum in the United States and peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard chart. "No Diggity" was later ranked at No. 91 on Rolling Stone and MTV: 100 Greatest Pop Songs. Another Level featured Mark Middleton and Eric Williams in place of Dave Hollister and Levi Little. Both Middleton and Williams were in groups prior to joining Blackstreet. Middleton was part of the short-lived Motown Records group Brik Citi. Williams was part of the trio The Flex, a group that sang on songs produced by their mentor Marley Marl. The success of Another Level landed them a guest appearance on 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-blackstreet');toggle_visibility('ma-jay-z');">
				<b><p2>Jay-Z's</p2></b>
			</a>
			"The City Is Mine" and they teamed with Mýa and Mase for the hit "Take Me There" from the Rugrats soundtrack. The success of Another Level would also land them a spot on New Edition's 1997 Home Again reunion tour.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blackstreet had a top ten album with Finally. The first single from the album, "Girlfriend/Boyfriend", was a collaboration with Janet Jackson featuring Ja Rule and Eve. However, personnel shifts wrecked the group and contributed to the relative failure of Finally and Blackstreet soon broke up.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Riley recorded a reunion album with Guy in 2000 and subsequently began working on material for his first solo record. Riley had second thoughts about disbanding Blackstreet and patched things up with Hannibal. Middleton and Williams returned to restore the Another Level lineup, and Riley's solo project became a Blackstreet reunion. After rumors of legal action and a preemptive countersuit, the group re-banded and released Level II.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After several failed attempts to keep Blackstreet together, all members eventually continued with solo careers for a time. However, in 2014 it was announced that past members Black, Little, Middleton, and Williams were back together under the Blackstreet moniker. They continued to perform with this lineup currently, and embarked on their second Australian tour in April 2015.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the mid-1950s, 10-year-old Bobby was touring with his brothers on the midwest gospel circuit as The Womack Brothers, along with Naomi on organ and Friendly Sr. on guitar. In 1954, under the moniker Curtis Womack and the Womack Brothers, the group issued the Pennant single, "Buffalo Bill". More records followed.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam Cooke, the lead singer of The Soul Stirrers, first saw the group performing in the mid-1950s. He became their mentor and helped them go on tour. They went on national tours with The Staple Singers. Even though Curtis often sang lead, Bobby was allowed to sing alongside him showcasing his gruff baritone vocals in contrast to his older brother's smoother tenor. During performances, Bobby would sometimes imitate the role of a preacher, which later became his nickname. At just 16, Bobby dropped out of high school.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the 1960s, Cooke formed SAR Records and signed the quintet to the label in 1961, where they released a handful of gospel singles. Then, Cooke changed their name to the Valentinos, relocated them to Los Angeles and convinced them to transition from gospel music to secular soul-and pop-influenced sound. Cooke produced and arranged the group's first hit single, "Lookin' for a Love", which was a pop version of the gospel song, "Couldn't Hear Nobody Pray", they had recorded earlier. The song became an R&B hit and helped land the group an opening spot for

			</a> tour. The group's next hit came in 1964 with the country-tinged "It's All Over Now", co-composed by Bobby. Their version was rising on the charts when

			</a> covered it.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Womack was also a member of Cooke's band, touring and recording with him from 1961. The Valentinos' career was left shaky after Sam Cooke was shot and killed in a Los Angeles motel. Devastated by the news, the brothers disbanded and SAR Records folded. Womack attempted to start his solo career in 1965, first recording for Him Records and later the Chess Records subsidiary, Checker Records. Womack faced backlash after his marriage to Cooke's widow Barbara Cooke. He would go to radio stations and disc jockeys would throw away his records. He continued to work as a session musician. Between 1965 and 1968, he toured and recorded with

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Nesta Marley, OM (6 February 1945 – 11 May 1981) was a Jamaican singer, songwriter, and musician. Considered one of the pioneers of reggae, his musical career was marked by fusing elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady, as well as his distinctive vocal and songwriting style. Marley's contributions to music increased the visibility of Jamaican music worldwide, and made him a global figure in popular culture for over a decade. Over the course of his career Marley became known as a Rastafari icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality. He is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture and identity, and was controversial in his outspoken support for the legalization of marijuana, while he also advocated for Pan-Africanism.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in Nine Mile, British Jamaica, Marley began his professional musical career in 1963, after forming Bob Marley and the Wailers. The group released its debut studio album The Wailing Wailers in 1965, which contained the single "One Love/People Get Ready"; the song was popular worldwide, and established the group as a rising figure in reggae. The Wailers subsequently released eleven further studio albums; while initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with the singer's conversion to Rastafarianism. During this period Marley relocated to London, and the group typified their musical shift with the release of the album The Best of The Wailers (1971).
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group attained international success after the release of the albums Catch a Fire and Burnin' (both 1973), and forged a reputation as touring artists. Following the disbandment of the Wailers a year later, Marley went on to release his solo material under the band's name. His debut studio album Natty Dread (1974) received positive reception, as did its follow-up Rastaman Vibration (1976). A few months after the album's release Marley survived an assassination attempt at his home in Jamaica, which prompted him to permanently relocate to London. During his time in London he recorded the album Exodus (1977); it incorporated elements of blues, soul, and British rock, enjoyed widespread commercial and critical success.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1977, Marley was diagnosed with acral lentiginous melanoma; he died as a result of the illness in 1981. His fans around the world expressed their grief, and he received a state funeral in Jamaica. The greatest hits album Legend was released in 1984, and became the best-selling reggae album of all time. Marley also ranks as one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of more than 75 million records worldwide. He was posthumously honored by Jamaica soon after his death with a designated Order of Merit by his nation. In 1994, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Rolling Stone ranked him No. 11 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cameo is an American soul-influenced funk group that formed in 1974. Cameo was initially a 14-member group known as the New York City Players; this name was later changed to Cameo, because there was already another band using that name. When his manager asked him to choose a new name for the band, Larry Blackmon saw a billboard ad for Cameo cigarettes outside of the window of the hotel he was staying at, and chose that name.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar (born October 11, 1992), known professionally as <b>Cardi B,</b> is an American rapper, songwriter, and actress. Born in Manhattan and raised in the Bronx, New York City, she became an Internet celebrity after several of her posts and videos became popular on Vine and Instagram. From 2015 to 2017, she appeared as a regular cast member on the VH1 reality television series Love & Hip Hop: New York, which depicted her pursuit of her music aspirations. She released two mixtapes—Gangsta Bitch Music, Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, before signing with label Atlantic Records in early 2017.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her debut studio album, Invasion of Privacy (2018), debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, broke several streaming records, was certified triple platinum by the RIAA and named by Billboard the top female rap album of the 2010s. Critically acclaimed, it won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, making Cardi B the only woman to win the award as a solo artist, as well as the first female rap artist in 15 years to be nominated for Album of the Year. It spawned two number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100; "Bodak Yellow", which made her the second female rapper to top the chart with a solo output—following

				<b><p2>Lauryn Hill</p2></b>
			</a> in 1998—and "I Like It", which made her the first female rapper to attain multiple number-one songs on the chart. Her Maroon 5 collaboration "Girls Like You" made her the only female rapper to top the Hot 100 three times. "WAP", the lead single of her second album, expanded her record as the female rapper with the most Hot 100 number-one singles as her fourth leader, and made her the only female rap artist to achieve chart-topping singles in two decades (2010s and 2020s).
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognized by Forbes as one of the most influential female rappers of all time, Cardi B is known for her aggressive flow and candid lyrics, which have received widespread media coverage. She is the highest-certified female rapper of all time on the RIAA's Top Artists (Digital Singles) ranking, also appearing among the ten highest-certified female artists and having the top certified song by a female rap artist. She is the only female rapper with multiple billion-streamers on Spotify. Her accolades include a Grammy Award, eight Billboard Music Awards, five Guinness World Records, four American Music Awards, eleven BET Hip Hop Awards and two ASCAP Songwriter of the Year awards. In 2018, Time included her on their annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carlton was born in Detroit, Michigan, and began his career in the mid-1960s as "Little Carl" Carlton. This was a marketing ploy to capitalize on some vocal similarities to Stevie Wonder, who recorded under the name "Little Stevie Wonder" in the early 1960s. His first recordings were for Lando Records, for which he recorded some minor local hits, including "So What" and "Don't You Need A Boy Like Me." In 1968, Don D. Robey had signed Carlton to the Back Beat Record label, of which Robey had started in 1957. Shortly after signing with the label, Carlton relocated to Houston, Texas, to be closer to his new label. His first single with the label, "Competition Ain't Nothing" became a huge hit on the UK northern soul scene after its release on the UK Action label. Carlton finally saw major success in the United States with a cover version of Robert Knight's "Everlasting Love." This song went to number 6 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number 11 on the Billboard R&B Charts in 1974.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robey sold his labels to ABC Records on May 23, 1973, two days after Carlton's 20th birthday. Beginning in 1976, Carlton became embroiled in a royalty dispute with ABC Records that caused him to stop recording for some time. He then signed with Mercury Records in 1977, but only released one single on that label. Carlton was unable to land a new recording contract for several years until Leon Haywood helped him get a singles deal with 20th Century Records.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Haywood-penned single, "She's a Bad Mama Jama (She's Built, She's Stacked)", became a major hit, peaking at number 2 on the soul chart and earning Carlton a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B Vocal Performance, Male in 1982. The track peaked at number 34 in the UK Singles Chart. Carlton's subsequent album, Carl Carlton, went gold in 1981. "She's a Bad Mama Jama" has since become a staple of compilation albums and soundtracks and is often sampled in rap music.

She is renowned for her powerful, technically skilled vocals, and remains the best-selling Canadian recording artist and one of the best-selling artists of all time with record sales of over 200 million worldwide. Born into a large family from Charlemagne, Quebec, she emerged as a teen star in her home country with a series of French-language albums during the 1980s. She first gained international recognition by winning both the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival and the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest, where she represented Switzerland. After learning to speak English, she signed on to Epic Records in the United States. In 1990, Dion released her debut English-language album, Unison, establishing herself as a viable pop artist in North America and other English-speaking areas of the world.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 1990s, she achieved worldwide fame after releasing several best-selling English-language albums, such as Falling into You (1996) and Let's Talk About Love (1997), which were both certified diamond in the US. She also scored a series of international number-one hits, including "The Power of Love", "Think Twice", "Because You Loved Me", "It's All Coming Back to Me Now", "My Heart Will Go On", and "I'm Your Angel". Dion continued releasing French albums between each English record; D'eux (1995) became the best-selling French-language album of all time, while S'il suffisait d'aimer (1998), Sans attendre (2012), and Encore un soir (2016), were all certified diamond in France. During the 2000s, she built her reputation as a highly successful live performer with A New Day... on the Las Vegas Strip (2003–07), which remains the highest-grossing concert residency of all time, as well as the Taking Chances World Tour (2008–09), one of the highest-grossing concert tours of all time.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dion's music has been influenced by genres ranging from rock and R&B to gospel and classical. Her recordings are mainly in French and English, although she also sings in Spanish, Italian, German, Latin, Japanese, and Mandarin Chinese. While her releases have often received mixed critical reception, she is regarded as one of pop music's most influential vocalists. She has won five Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year. Billboard named her the "Queen of Adult Contemporary" for having the most number-one songs on the radio format for a female artist. She is the second best-selling female artist in the US during the Nielsen SoundScan era. In 2003, she was honoured by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for selling over 50 million albums in Europe.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curtis Lee Mayfield (June 3, 1942 – December 26, 1999) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer, and one of the most influential musicians behind soul and politically conscious African-American music. He first achieved success and recognition with The Impressions during the civil rights movement of the late 1950s and 1960s, and later worked as a solo artist.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in Chicago, Illinois, Mayfield started his musical career in a gospel choir. Moving to the North Side, he met Jerry Butler in 1956 at the age of 14, and joined the vocal group The Impressions. As a songwriter, Mayfield became noted as one of the first musicians to bring more prevalent themes of social awareness into soul music. In 1965, he wrote "People Get Ready" for the Impressions, which displayed his more politically charged songwriting. Ranked at no. 24 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, the song received numerous other awards, and was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, as well as being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving the Impressions in 1970 in the pursuit of a solo career, Mayfield released several albums, including the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film Super Fly in 1972. The soundtrack was noted for its socially conscious themes, mostly addressing problems surrounding inner city minorities such as crime, poverty and drug abuse. The album was ranked at no. 72 on Rolling Stone's list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mayfield was paralyzed from the neck down after lighting equipment fell on him during a live performance at Wingate Field in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York, on August 13, 1990. Despite this, he continued his career as a recording artist, releasing his final album New World Order in 1996. Mayfield won a Grammy Legend Award in 1994 and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. He is a double inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of the Impressions in 1991, and again in 1999 as a solo artist. He was also a two-time Grammy Hall of Fame inductee. He died from complications of type 2 diabetes at the age of 57 on December 26, 1999.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daryl Franklin Hohl (born October 11, 1946), known professionally as Daryl Hall, is an American rock, R&B, and soul singer; keyboardist, guitarist, songwriter, and producer, best known as the co-founder and principal lead vocalist of Hall & Oates (with guitarist and songwriter 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-daryl-hall');toggle_visibility('ma-john-oates');">
				<b><p2>John Oates).</p2></b>
			</a>
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1970s and early 1980s, Hall scored numerous Billboard chart hits and is regarded as one of the best soul singers of his generation. Guitarist Robert Fripp, who collaborated with him in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has written, "Daryl's pipes were a wonder. I have never worked with a more able singer." Since late 2007, he has hosted the web television series Live from Daryl's House, which is now aired on AXS TV. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2014.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to his work with Oates, Hall has made music as a solo artist, as well as recording with Robert Fripp in the late ‘70s, working on Fripp’s critically praised Exposure album from 1979. In 1977 Fripp produced and performed on Hall's debut solo album, the much-acclaimed Sacred Songs. This album was released in 1980.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1984 Hall co-wrote and produced, with Arthur Baker, the single "Swept Away" for 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-daryl-hall');toggle_visibility('ma-diana-ross');">
				<b><p2>Diana Ross,</p2></b>
			</a> which reached US No. 19, US R & B No. 3 and US Dance/Club Play No. 1.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2007 Hall guest-starred on the HBO series Flight of the Conchords, playing an MC of a "world music" festival.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 12, 2008, Hall played a well-received set with his band at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 11, 2010, Hall shared the stage with electronic duo Chromeo for a special late night set at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. Their set consisted of a mix of both Hall & Oates and Chromeo tracks.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August 12, 2011, UK Electronic duo Nero released their debut album "Welcome Reality", which features guest vocals by Hall on the track "Reaching Out", which also samples Hall & Oates' 80's hit Out of Touch. Reaching Out was released as the sixth single on December 6, 2011.

			in 1970, Ross released her eponymous debut solo album that same year, featuring the US number-one hit "Ain't No Mountain High Enough". It was followed with her second solo album, Everything Is Everything, which spawned her first UK number-one single "I'm Still Waiting". She continued a successful solo career through the 1970s, which included hit albums like Touch Me in the Morning (1973), Mahogany (1975) and Diana Ross (1976) and their number-one hit singles, "Touch Me in the Morning", "Theme from Mahogany" and "Love Hangover", respectively.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LaDonna Adrian Gaines (December 31, 1948 – May 17, 2012), widely known by her stage name based on her married name Donna Summer, was an American singer, songwriter and actress. She gained prominence during the disco era of the 1970s and became known as the "Queen of Disco", while her music gained a global following.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While influenced by the counterculture of the 1960s, Summer became the lead singer of a psychedelic rock band named Crow and moved to New York City. Joining a touring version of the musical Hair, she left New York and spent several years living, acting and singing in Europe, where she met music producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte in Munich, where they recorded influential disco hits such as "Love to Love You Baby" and "I Feel Love", marking her breakthrough into an international career. Summer returned to the United States in 1975, and other hits such as "Last Dance", "MacArthur Park", "Heaven Knows", "Hot Stuff", "Bad Girls", "Dim All the Lights", "No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)" (duet with Barbra Streisand) and "On the Radio" followed.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summer earned a total of 42 hit singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 in her lifetime, with 14 of those reaching the top-ten. She claimed a top 40 hit every year between 1975 and 1984, and from her first top-ten hit in 1976, to the end of 1982, she had 12 top-ten hits (10 were top-five hits), more than any other act during that time period. She returned to the Hot 100's top-five in 1983, and claimed her final top-ten hit in 1989 with "This Time I Know It's for Real". She was the first artist to have three consecutive double albums reach number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and charted four number-one singles in the US within a 12-month period. She also charted two number-one singles on the R&B Singles chart in the US and a number-one single in the United Kingdom. Her most recent Hot 100 hit came in 1999 with "I Will Go with You (Con Te Partiro)". While her fortunes on the Hot 100 waned through those decades, Summer remained a force on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart over her entire career.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show (shortened to Dr. Hook in 1975) was an American rock band, formed in Union City, New Jersey. They enjoyed considerable commercial success in the 1970s with hit singles including "Sylvia's Mother", "The Cover of 'Rolling Stone'" (both 1972), "Only Sixteen" (1975), "A Little Bit More" (1976), "Sharing the Night Together" (1978), "When You're in Love with a Beautiful Woman" (1979), "Better Love Next Time" (1979), and "Sexy Eyes" (1980). In addition to their own material, Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show performed songs written by the poet Shel Silverstein.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The band had eight years of regular chart hits in the United States, where their music was played on top-40, easy listening, and country music outlets, and throughout the English-speaking world including the UK, Canada and South Africa. Their music spanned several genres, mostly novelty songs and acoustic ballads in their early years, though their greatest success came with their later material, mostly consisting of disco-influenced soft rock, which the band recorded under the shortened name Dr. Hook.

			</a> and collaborator Angie Stone.
			<br><br>
			Born in Richmond, Virginia, the son of a Pentecostal minister, D'Angelo taught himself piano as a child. At eighteen, he won the amateur talent competition at Harlem's Apollo Theater three weeks in a row. After a brief affiliation with hip-hop group I.D.U., his first major success came in 1994 as the co-writer and co-producer of the song "U Will Know".
			<br><br>
			His debut solo album, Brown Sugar (1995), received positive reviews and sold over two million copies. His next album, Voodoo (2000), debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200. Its lead single "Untitled (How Does It Feel)", entered the R&B charts and won a Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal; likewise, Voodoo won Best R&B Album. D'Angelo was hailed as the next

				<b><p2>Marvin Gaye</p2></b>
			</a> by GQ in 2014.
			<br><br>
			Following this period, D'Angelo became more than uncomfortable with his growing status as a sex symbol. This was followed by numerous personal struggles including alcoholism, and a fourteen-year long musical hiatus. D'Angelo released his third studio album, Black Messiah, in December 2014. The album was met with critical acclaim and fared well on music charts, peaking at number five on the US Billboard 200. D'Angelo also contributed to the soundtrack for the 2018 video game Red Dead Redemption 2, performing the song "Unshaken".

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earl Donald Young (born June 2, 1940) is a Philadelphia-based drummer who rose to prominence in the early 1970s as part of the Philly Soul sound. Young is best known as the founder and leader of 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-earl-young');toggle_visibility('ma-the-trammps');">
				<b><p2>The Trammps</p2></b>
			</a> who had a hit record with "Disco Inferno". Young, along with Ronnie Baker and Norman Harris (the trio best known as Baker-Harris-Young), was the owner of the Golden Fleece record label.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young is seen as the inventor of the disco style of rock drumming (in Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes's "The Love I Lost" from 1973), and is often credited with popularizing four-on-the-floor bass drum beats, and as being the first drummer to make extensive and distinctive use of the hi-hat cymbal throughout the playing time of an R&B song. This led to DJs favoring his recordings because they could hear the cymbal quite easily in their headphones as they "cued up" records to be mixed.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-sixties Young played drums on many recordings for the Philadelphia-based record label "ARCTIC" (Records), on which his own band "The Volcanos" (later formed to The Trammps) was signed (e.g. The Ambassadors – "Ain't Got The Love Of One Girl (On My Mind)", Della Humphrey - "Let's Wait Until Dark", Kenny Gamble - "The Jokes on You", in 1969 the whole Ambassadors LP "Soul Summit"). He also played for the Philadelphia-based record label "Phil L.A. Of Soul" on Cliff Nobles & Co. - "Love Is All Right (The Horse)" in 1968 (a Jesse Martin production), a popular Northern Soul classic.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994, Benét signed with Warner Bros. Records, releasing his solo debut album, True to Myself in 1996. Individual songs from the album were successful, including the top-ten R&B hits "Spiritual Thang", "Femininity" and "Let's Stay Together", which originally appeared on the soundtrack of the film A Thin Line Between Love and Hate.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In between albums, Eric collaborated with his then-labelmates Somethin' for the People on their 1997 album This Time It's Personal singing leads on the single "Act Like You Want It". His next album, A Day in the Life, was released in 1999. Its first single, "Georgy Porgy (featuring Faith Evans)" received significant airplay, but the second single, "Spend My Life With You (featuring Tamia)", became a smash hit. "Spend My Life With You" rose to number one on the American R&B charts, was certified gold, and nominated for a 2000 Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group. The album, A Day in the Life also won a Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Album, Male.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benét also recorded for 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-eric-benet');toggle_visibility('ma-ewf');">
				<b><p2>Earth, Wind, and Fire's</p2></b>
			</a> 30th anniversary CD. He contributed vocals to the post-Katrina charity single, "Heart of America", along with Michael McDonald, Wynonna Judd, and Terry Dexter. He has also lent his vocals to many jazz albums for such artists as Wayman Tisdale, George Duke, Chris Botti, Jeff Lorber, and Boney James.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benét recorded his following album Better and Better in 2001, but Warner Bros. rejected to release this album and forced him to stay in the R&B genre. Due to the controversy about music style and creative freedom, Benét changed to Reprise-distributed label Friday Records and recorded his next album, Hurricane. Thus Hurricane became his third released studio album on June 21, 2005 in the US. "I Wanna Be Loved" was the song that received the most airplay. The single reached number two on the Urban Adult Contemporary chart.

			</a> in 1994 in Fort Worth; record label executive Kedar Massenburg was highly impressed with her performance and signed her to Kedar Entertainment. Her first album, Baduizm, was released in February 1997. It spawned four singles: "On & On", "Appletree", "Next Lifetime" and "Otherside of the Game". The album was certified triple Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Her first live album, Live, was released in November 1997 and was certified double Platinum by the RIAA.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her second studio album, Mama's Gun, was released in 2000. It spawned three singles: "Bag Lady", which became her first top 10 single on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #6, "Didn't Cha Know?" and "Cleva". The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA. Badu's third album, Worldwide Underground, was released in 2003. It generated three singles: "Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip-Hop)", "Danger" and "Back in the Day (Puff)" with 'Love' becoming her second song to reach the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #9. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA. Badu's fourth album, New Amerykah Part One, was released in 2008. It spawned two singles: "Honey" and "Soldier". New Amerykah Part Two was released in 2010 and fared well both critically and commercially. It contained the album's lead single "Window Seat", which led to controversy.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Badu’s voice has been compared to jazz singer Billie Holiday. Early in her career, Badu was recognizable for her eccentric style, which often included wearing very large and colorful headwraps. She was a core member of the Soulquarians. As an actress, she has played a number of supporting roles in movies including Blues Brothers 2000, The Cider House Rules and House of D. She also has appeared in the documentaries Before the Music Dies and The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth, Wind & Fire (abbreviated as EW&F or simply EWF) is an American band that has spanned the musical genres of R&B, soul, funk, jazz, disco, pop, rock, dance, Latin, and Afro pop. They have been described as one of the most innovative and commercially successful acts of all time. Rolling Stone called them "innovative, precise yet sensual, calculated yet galvanizing" and declared that the band "changed the sound of black pop". VH1 has also described EWF as "one of the greatest bands" ever.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The band was founded in Chicago by Maurice White in 1969, having grown out of a previous band known as the Salty Peppers. As well other prominent members of EWF have included Philip Bailey, Verdine White, Ralph Johnson, Larry Dunn, Al McKay, Roland Bautista, Robert Brookins, Sonny Emory, Fred Ravel, Ronnie Laws, Sheldon Reynolds and Andrew Woolfolk. The band is known for its kalimba sound, dynamic horn section, energetic and elaborate stage shows, and the contrast between Philip Bailey's falsetto vocals and Maurice White's baritone.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The band has won six Grammys from their 17 nominations and four American Music Awards out of 12 nominations. They have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the NAACP Image Award Hall of Fame, and Hollywood's Rockwalk, in addition to receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. With sales of over 90 million records, they are one of the world's best-selling bands of all time.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat Freddy's Drop is a New Zealand seven-piece band from Wellington, whose musical style has been characterised as any combination of dub, reggae, soul, jazz, rhythm and blues, and techno. Originally a jam band formed in the late 1990s by musicians from other bands in Wellington, Fat Freddy's Drop gradually became its members' sole focus. Band members continued playing with their other respective groups—The Black Seeds, TrinityRoots, Bongmaster, and others—for much of their 20-year career. Fat Freddy's Drop are known for their improvised live performances. Songs on their studio albums are versions refined over years of playing them live in New Zealand and on tour abroad.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group gained international recognition in 2003 after their single "Midnight Marauders" was re-distributed by record labels and DJs in Germany. The group has toured Europe nearly every year since then. The first studio album by Fat Freddy's Drop, Based on a True Story, was the first independently distributed album to reach first place in New Zealand record sales directly after release in 2005, and is the highest-selling album by a national artist in the country's history. Based on a True Story won Best Album at the New Zealand Music Awards the same year, and remained on the top 40 New Zealand sales chart for over two years, establishing them as one of the most successful contemporary bands in the island nation.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fleetwood Mac are a British-American rock band, formed in London in 1967. Fleetwood Mac were founded by guitarist Peter Green, drummer Mick Fleetwood and guitarist Jeremy Spencer, before bassist John McVie joined the lineup for their self-titled debut album. Danny Kirwan joined as a third guitarist in 1968. Keyboardist Christine Perfect, who contributed as a session musician from the second album, married McVie and joined in 1970.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primarily a British blues band, Fleetwood Mac scored a UK number one with "Albatross", and had other hits such as the singles "Oh Well" and "Man of the World". All three guitarists left in succession during the early 1970s, to be replaced by guitarists Bob Welch and Bob Weston and vocalist Dave Walker. By 1974, all three of them had either departed or been dismissed, leaving the band without a male lead vocalist or guitarist. In late 1974, while Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he was introduced to American folk-rock duo Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Fleetwood Mac soon asked Buckingham to be their new lead guitarist, and Buckingham agreed on condition that Nicks would also join the band.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more pop rock sound, and their 1975 self-titled album, Fleetwood Mac, reached No. 1 in the United States. Rumours (1977), Fleetwood Mac's second album after the arrival of Buckingham and Nicks, produced four U.S. Top 10 singles and remained at number one on the American albums chart for 31 weeks. It also reached the top spot in various countries around the world and won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978. Rumours has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums in history. The band went through personal turmoil while recording the album, as both the romantic partnerships in the band (one being John and Christine McVie, and the other being Buckingham and Nicks) separated while continuing to make music together.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fugees was an American hip hop group who rose to fame in the mid-1990s. Their repertoire included elements of hip hop, soul and Caribbean music, particularly reggae. The members of the group were Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill, and Pras Michel. Deriving their name from a shortening of the word "refugees", Jean and Michel are Haitian while Hill is American.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before disbanding in 1997, the group recorded two albums, one of which, The Score (1996), was a multi-Platinum and Grammy-winning success and contains their hit single "Killing Me Softly". Hill and Jean each went on to successful solo recording careers; Michel focused on soundtrack recordings and acting, though he found commercial success with his song "Ghetto Supastar". In 2007, MTV ranked them the ninth greatest hip-hop group of all time.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lauryn Hill and Pras first met at Columbia High School, in Maplewood, New Jersey. Pras, Lauryn, and a mutual friend Marcy Harriell formed a musical trio called Tyme; Pras' cousin, Wyclef Jean, joined the trio and Marcy left soon after in 1990. The moniker Tranzlator Crew refers to the name of their band at the time, which included Johnny Wise on drums, Ti Bass (Jerry) on bass guitar, and Leon (DJ). In 1993, after some gigs and recorded demos, the trio signed to Ruffhouse, distributed through Columbia Records. The trio's name was later changed to Fugees, which was purposely taken from a word often used derogatorily to refer to Haitian-Americans (refugee). Refugee Camp, while a name sometimes credited to the trio, also refers to a number of artists affiliated with them, and particularly Jean.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trio soon changed musical direction, and released their first hip-hop LP, Blunted on Reality, in 1994 under the guidance of 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-fugees');toggle_visibility('ma-kool-and-the-gang');">
				<b><p2>Kool and the Gang's</p2></b>
			</a> producer Ronald Bell. Although the album did not contain as many lyrics with overtly political messages as songs from The Score, there were still political intentions. The album spawned the singles "Boof Baf", "Nappy Heads" and "Vocab", but gained little mainstream attention, despite earning plaudits for its artistic quality and innovative use of samples.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George Edward Clinton (born July 22, 1941) is a very
			famous American singer, songwriter, bandleader, and 
			record producer. 
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Parliament-Funkadelic collective (which primarily 
			recorded under the distinct band names Parliament 
			and Funkadelic) developed an influential and eclectic 
			form of funk music during the 1970s that drew on 
			science fiction, outlandish fashion, psychedelia, and 
			surreal humor.
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s fitting that we spoke with one of the greatest innovators in Black Music this month, George Clinton. We all know and love him as the godfather of funk, but it might surprise you to learn that his life and his work has involved a whole lot more than his legendary funky grooves. From doo wop to 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-george-clinton');toggle_visibility('ma-motown');">
				<b><p2>Motown</p2></b>
			</a>and hip hop, Dr Funkenstein is a walking, talking, grooving history lesson for us all. 
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George Clinton’s music is innovation at its finest. Magical. Other worldly. But when we look at what was going on in pop culture when he first formed Parliament and Funkadelic, the magnitude of his genius becomes clear. On the heels of a groundbreaking 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-george-clinton');toggle_visibility('ma-motown');">
				<b><p2>Motown</p2></b>
			</a>era, in the early days of Philadelphia Soul, just as disco grooves were blowing our minds and punk rock was changing the way we thought about music, George Clinton came out of not- just-left-field but out of a field we never even knew existed. He created something so new and different that it became a whole genre unto itself and P-Funk was born.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And although we like to think that he descended to Earth in the mothership, George Clinton had actually been amassing influences for years from far flung places like Detroit, New Jersey and Europe to craft his new works of art.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After singing doo wop on street corners in New Jersey as a teen, George made his way to Detroit and became a staff songwriter for 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-george-clinton');toggle_visibility('ma-motown');">
				<b><p2>Motown</p2></b>
			</a>. While he was there, 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-george-clinton');toggle_visibility('ma-smokey-robinson');">
				<b><p2>Smokey Robinson</p2></b>
			</a>, Berry Gordy, Holland-Dozier-Holland and production teams like Ashford and Simpson all left a powerful impression on the young artist. “That was the team that was just unbeatable,” he remembers of his own personal Motown era. While soaking in the best that R&B had to offer, George also kept one eye - or should we say ear - aimed at Europe. A new crop of musicians, ones who idolized the blues, were emerging and their music was loud and exciting. “I listened to groups like Cream, those kinds of British groups, and it made me go back to learn about a lot of the older blues musicians,” he says gratefully.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“That European version of rock and roll was real loud and psychedelic, as they called it. I saw that things were changing. So we did some of the same things with the 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-george-clinton');toggle_visibility('ma-motown');">
				<b><p2>Motown</p2></b>
			</a>music we were working on. We made it loud with a lot of emphasis on the bottom, the bass, and we called that Funkadelic as opposed to psychedelic. That’s when we invented the ‘free your mind and your ass will follow’ concept,” he laughs. “It wasn’t the blues, like with those European rock bands. It was midtempo just like Motown and music out of New Orleans. But it was really loud.”
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1969 until 1974, George made loud, technicolor music. With the arrival of Bootsy Collins came the addition of horns. “We had the horns, which added in a Sly Stone and 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-george-clinton');toggle_visibility('ma-james-brown');">
				<b><p2>James Brown</p2></b>
			</a>type of sound. Our intentions were straight dance music but still keep it funky with the freedom of arrangement. We were all over the place.” P-Funk were mashing up all kinds of music into a mystical gumbo. It was new and exciting and fans loved it.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It was the same kind of thing that hip hop is doing,” George points out. “They started taking samples of records and the songs became like a radio station playing all of those records in one record….like a DJ changing sounds.”
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of hip hop, George Clinton has appeared on songs from 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-george-clinton');toggle_visibility('ma-kendrick-lamar');">
				<b><p2>Kendrick Lamar</p2></b>
			</a>to Grandmaster Flash, Public Enemy to Snoop. “P-Funk just kept growing into whatever new sound that we came up with or somebody else came up with,” he explains. “Like when hip hop came up we just became a part of that. I try to insert my funk into whatever’s going on,” he adds, laughing.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does he still do it after all these years? How does he keep growing and being innovative and working with emerging talent and musical styles? “Soon as I hear something getting on my nerves, I start paying attention to what is going on. That’s usually the next new music,” he says, only half jokingly. “And if you get in early enough you’re not copying, you’re growing along with it.”
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George will always have one eye on the future, but this time next year, he’ll be doing the watching from his musical laboratory instead of from the road. Last month, George Clinton announced that he will retire from touring in May 2019. We, and all of our guests, are so grateful to be able to see him in his final year of touring while on the 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-george-clinton');toggle_visibility('ma-soul-train');">
				<b><p2>Soul Train</p2></b>
			</a>Cruise. And George is looking forward to a lot on the cruise himself.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Maybe I can gorge on the food,” he jokes. “And the places we go to - I like checking them out.” He also was eager to share a packing tip with all of you. “Bring two bootys,” he laughs. People are going to love the concert. They’re going to feel it in their butt. So I’m telling you to bring two bootys.”

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;George Michael was an English singer, songwriter, record producer, and philanthropist who rose to fame as a member of the music duo Wham! and later embarked on a solo career. Michael sold over 80 million records worldwide making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He achieved seven number one songs on the UK Singles Chart and eight number one songs on the US Billboard Hot 100. Michael won various music awards including two Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards, three American Music Awards, 12 Billboard Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards and six Ivor Novello Awards. In 2008, he was ranked 40th on Billboard's list of the Greatest Hot 100 Artists of All Time.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael, who came out as gay in 1998, was an active LGBT rights campaigner and HIV/AIDS charity fundraiser. Michael's personal life and legal troubles made headlines during the late 1990s and 2000s, as he was arrested for public lewdness in 1998 and was arrested for multiple drug-related offences after that time. The 2005 documentary A Different Story covered his career and personal life. Michael's first tour since 1991, the 25 Live tour, spanned three tours over the course of three years; 2006, 2007, and 2008. Four years later, he performed his final concert at London's Earls Court in 2012. In the early hours of 25 December 2016, Michael was found dead at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire aged 53. A coroner's report attributed his death to natural causes.

Ginuwine began his career as a member of Swing Mob in the early 1990s. Signing to Epic Records as a solo artist in the mid-1990s, Ginuwine has released a number of multi-platinum and platinum-selling albums and singles, becoming one of R&B's top artists during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'Shea Jackson better known by his stage name Ice Cube, is an American rapper, actor, and filmmaker. His lyrics on N.W.A's 1988 album Straight Outta Compton contributed to gangsta rap's widespread popularity. His solo albums of 1990 and 1991 consist of political rap. In 1991 and 1995, entering film, he starred in Boyz n the Hood and cocreated Friday.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first rap group, C.I.A., formed in 1986. In 1987, with Eazy-E and 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-ice-cube');toggle_visibility('ma-dr-dre');">
				<b><p2>Dr. Dre,</p2></b>
			</a> he formed a pioneering gangsta rap group, N.W.A. Its lead rapper, Cube wrote some of Dre's and most of Eazy's lyrics on Straight Outta Compton. A landmark that shaped West Coast rap's first identity apart from East Coast rap, this album introduced lyrics extremely violent, threatening to attack abusive police and innocent civilians alike, lyrics that redrew boundaries. Leaving N.W.A in late 1989 via monetary dispute with its management by Eazy-E and by Jerry Heller, Cube teamed with New York artists and launched a solo rap career.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His first two solo albums, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted in 1990 and Death Certificate in 1991, were also forceful and controversial, criticizing whites, blacks, women, gay men, the Jewish man Jerry Heller, and Korean store owners. Overall, the lyrics frame ideas of black struggle and black nationalism in a street reformulation of Nation of Islam ideology, initiating recurrent accusations that Ice Cube is antisemitic. Swiftly certified Platinum, these two albums, especially the latter, widely esteemed as sociopolitical criticism, are cited by later rappers as key influences, and place Cube on lists of the greatest rappers.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He entered cinema by playing Doughboy in director John Singleton's feature debut Boyz n the Hood, a 1991 drama, namesake of an 1987 rap song that Cube wrote. Cube cowrote and starred in the 1995 comedy film Friday, "coarse and ribald," premising Friday sequels, reshaping his persona into friendly movie star. His directorial debut was a 1998 film, The Player's Club. By 2020, his acting roles include about 40 films, like the 1999 war comedy Three Kings, family comedies like the Barbershop series begun in 2002, and the Ride Along comedies near 2015. He was an executive producer of some of these, and of the 2015 biopic Straight Outta Compton, on N.W.A's story.

The album was also certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry and platinum by Music Canada. The album was promoted with the release of the lead single "Video". "Video" attained commercial success peaking at forty seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 and becoming her highest charting song in the region to date.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jackson 5 (stylized as the Jackson 5ive), later known as the Jacksons, is an American pop band composed of members of the Jackson family. The group was founded in 1965 in Gary, Indiana, by brothers Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine, with younger brothers Marlon and Michael joining soon after.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jackson 5 performed in talent shows and clubs on the Chitlin' Circuit, then signed with Steeltown Records in 1967 and released two singles. In 1968, they left Steeltown Records and signed with Motown, where they were the first group to debut with four consecutive number one hits on the Billboard Hot 100 with the songs "I Want You Back", "ABC", "The Love You Save", and "I'll Be There". They also achieved 16 top-40 singles on the chart. The group left Motown for Epic Records in early 1976, with the exception of Jermaine, who was replaced by Randy. At Epic, they released four studio albums and one live album between 1976 and 1981, including the successful albums Destiny (1978) and Triumph (1980) and the singles "Enjoy Yourself", "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)", and "Can You Feel It".
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brothers also released solo albums, most successfully Michael. In 1983, Jermaine reunited with the band to perform on the Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever TV special. They released the Victory album the following year, followed by an extensive tour which also featured songs from Michael's solo albums. After the Victory tour, Michael and Marlon Jackson left the group. The remaining four released the poorly received 2300 Jackson Street album in 1989 before being dropped from their label. In 2001, the Jacksons reunited on Michael's 30th Anniversary Celebration TV special. The four eldest of the brothers embarked on their Unity Tour in 2012 following Michael's death, and they planned several major performances for 2017.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to some sources, The Jackson 5 have sold more than 100 million records worldwide. In 1980 the brothers were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame as the Jacksons. They were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. Two of the band's recordings ("ABC" and "I Want You Back") are among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll and, alongside "I'll Be There", were also inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wright was brought to the attention of hip-hop group The Roots in 1998, which eventually led to her going to tour with them. She later appeared as a back-up singer for

			</a> in 2001, and appeared in a Coca-Cola advert as part of the brand's "Nu Soul" campaign.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has released two solo albums to date: Denials, Delusions & Decisions in 2002, and Divorcing Neo 2 Marry Soul in 2005. Wright also recorded an album entitled ...And Your Point Is? which was due for release in 2003 on MCA Records (who also distributed her debut), before the label folded. However, many of the tracks recorded for that album later appeared on Divorcing Neo 2 Marry Soul.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2007, two new songs appeared on her MySpace profile. One was a live version of new song "Sometimes", the other a cover of "Let's Do It Again". A further two new songs surfaced in 2009, "Beautiful" and "Surely Shawty", although neither saw an official release.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has toured every year since her debut album was released. In March 2008, she toured Europe with Bahamadia and Hezekiah for the "Philly Sounds" tour. Wright did not perform any new material on the tour, but did live cover versions of Cherrelle's "Saturday Love" and Crystal Waters' "Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)". During the tour, Wright announced that she was in the process of writing a novel, and working on a third album. No release dates have been confirmed for either as yet.

			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January 2011, Jaguar Wright toured Europe with Lady Alma on the "Philly Sounds 2011" tour. She revealed that she was working on a third album, due out in the summer of 2011, the lead single from the new album to be called "Switch".
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer of 2012, she assembled a "rock & soul band" of seasoned Philadelphia musicians called The W.E. ft. Jaguar Wright. The W.E. (an acronym for "The Wright Experience") had its debut performance in October 2012.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2020, Wright made headlines via social media regarding issues such as the trajectory of her music career, her fallout with several members of the Roots, as well as her grievances with artists such as

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Joseph Brown (May 3, 1933 – December 25, 2006) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, musician, record producer and bandleader. A progenitor of funk music and a major figure of 20th century music and dance, he is often referred to by the honorific nicknames "Godfather of Soul", "Mr. Dynamite", and "Soul Brother No. 1".[1] In a career that lasted over 50 years, he influenced the development of several music genres. Brown was one of the first ten inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at its inaugural induction dinner in New York on January 23, 1986.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown began his career as a gospel singer in Toccoa, Georgia. He first came to national public attention in the mid-1950s as the lead singer of The Famous Flames, a rhythm and blues vocal group founded by Bobby Byrd. With the hit ballads "Please, Please, Please" and "Try Me", Brown built a reputation as a tireless live performer with the Famous Flames and his backing band, sometimes known as the James Brown Band or the James Brown Orchestra. His success peaked in the 1960s with the live album Live at the Apollo and hit singles such as "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag", "I Got You (I Feel Good)" and "It's a Man's Man's Man's World".
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the late 1960s, Brown moved from a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a profoundly "Africanized" approach to music-making, emphasizing stripped-down and interlocking rhythms, that influenced the development of funk music. By the early 1970s, Brown had fully established the funk sound after the formation of the J.B.s with records such as "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine" and "The Payback". He also became noted for songs of social commentary, including the 1968 hit "Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud". Brown continued to perform and record until his death from pneumonia in 2006.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown recorded 17 singles that reached No. 1 on the Billboard R&B charts. He also holds the record for the most singles listed on the Billboard Hot 100 chart which did not reach No. 1. Brown was inducted into the first class of the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2013 as an artist and then in 2017 as a songwriter. He also received honors from many other institutions, including inductions into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In Joel Whitburn's analysis of the Billboard R&B charts from 1942 to 2010, Brown is ranked No. 1 in The Top 500 Artists. He is ranked No. 7 on Rolling Stone's list of its 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969), known professionally as Jay-Z (stylized as JAY-Z), is an American rapper, songwriter, record executive, businessman, and record producer. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential hip-hop artists in history, and often cited as one of the greatest rappers of all time.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born and raised in New York City, Jay-Z first began his musical career after founding the record label Roc-A-Fella Records in 1995, and subsequently released his debut studio album Reasonable Doubt in 1996. The album was released to widespread critical success, and solidified his standing in the music industry. He has gone on to release twelve additional albums, including the acclaimed albums, The Blueprint (2001), The Black Album (2003), American Gangster (2007), and 4:44 (2017). Jay-Z has also released the full-length collaborative albums Watch the Throne (2011) with

			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-jay-z');toggle_visibility('ma-beyonce');">
				<b><p2>Beyoncé,</p2></b>
			</a> respectively.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of his musical career, Jay-Z has also attained significant success and media attention for his career as a businessman. In 1999, he founded the clothing retailer Rocawear, and in 2003, he founded the luxury sports bar chain 40/40 Club. Both businesses have grown to become multi-million-dollar corporations, and allowed Jay-Z to fund the start-up for the entertainment company Roc Nation, which was founded in 2008. In 2015, he acquired the tech company Aspiro and took charge of their media streaming service Tidal.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jay-Z is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with over 50 million albums and 75 million singles sold worldwide. He has won a total of 22 Grammy Awards, the most by a rapper, and holds the record for the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the Billboard 200, with 14. He has been ranked by Billboard and fellow music publication Rolling Stone as one of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2017, he became the first rapper to be honored into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in 2018, received the commemorative "Salute to Industry Icons" award at the 60th Grammy Awards. In June 2019, Jay-Z officially became the first hip hop billionaire, making him the fifth-wealthiest African American and the wealthiest American musician.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jennifer Lynn Lopez (born July 24, 1969), also known by her nickname J.Lo, is an American actress, singer, dancer, fashion designer, producer, and businesswoman. In 1991, Lopez began appearing as a Fly Girl dancer on In Living Color, where she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. For her first leading role in the 1997 Selena biopic of the same name, Lopez became the first Latin actress to earn over US$1 million for a film. She went on to star in Anaconda (1997) and Out of Sight (1998), later establishing herself as the highest-paid Latin actress in Hollywood.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lopez ventured into the music industry with her debut studio album On the 6 (1999), which helped propel the Latin pop movement in American music. With the simultaneous release of her second studio album J.Lo and her romantic comedy The Wedding Planner in 2001, Lopez became the first woman to have a number-one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 remix album, J to tha L–O! The Remixes, became the first in history to debut atop the US Billboard 200. Later that year, she released her third studio album This Is Me... Then, and starred in the US box office number-one Maid in Manhattan.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After starring in Gigli (2003), a critical and commercial failure, Lopez subsequently starred in the successful romantic comedies Shall We Dance? (2004) and Monster-in-Law (2005). Her fifth studio album, Como Ama una Mujer (2007), received the highest first-week sales for a debut Spanish album in the United States. Following an unsuccessful period, she returned to prominence in 2011 with her appearance as a judge on American Idol, and released her seventh studio album Love?. From 2016 to 2018, she starred in the crime drama series Shades of Blue and performed a residency show, Jennifer Lopez: All I Have, at Planet Hollywood Las Vegas. Since 2017, Lopez has produced and served as a judge on World of Dance. In 2019, she garnered critical acclaim for her performance as a stripper in the crime drama Hustlers.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Oates' main role in the duo was guitarist, he also co-wrote many of the top 10 songs that they recorded, including (with Hall): "Sara Smile" (the song refers to Hall's then-girlfriend, Sara Allen), "She's Gone", and "Out of Touch", as well as (with Allen and Hall): "You Make My Dreams", "I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)", "Maneater", and "Adult Education". He also sang lead vocals on several more singles in the Hot 100, such as "How Does It Feel to Be Back", "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" (a remake of the 1965 song performed by the Righteous Brothers that was written by Phil Spector, Barry Mann, and Cynthia Weil), on which Oates shared lead vocals with Hall, and "Possession Obsession" (with Allen & Hall).
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially in the duo's 1970s output, the songwriting on the albums was usually very evenly divided, with Oates writing many of the tracks on his own along with many co-written songs. For example, on Daryl Hall & John Oates—released in 1975 and the duo's first top-20 album—most of the songs were co-written, along with two songs by Oates and one by Hall, making it the only album where Oates is credited on more songs than Hall.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1986, Oates contributed the song "(She's the) Shape of Things to Come" on the soundtrack to the 1986 film, About Last Night. Oates also co-wrote and sang backup on the song "Electric Blue", recorded by the Australian band Icehouse, which was a Billboard top 10 hit. He also co-wrote, produced and sang duet with the Canadian group the Parachute Club on the 1987 song "Love Is Fire", which was a top 30 hit in Canada.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oates played the character "Dirty D" in an episode of the eponymously named comedy TV series Garfunkel and Oates.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oates was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2004, and in 2014, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of Hall & Oates. His memoir, Change of Seasons, was published in 2017.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justin Randall Timberlake (born January 31, 1981), occasionally known by his initials JT, is an American singer, songwriter, actor, and record producer. Born and raised in Tennessee, he appeared on the television shows Star Search and The All-New Mickey Mouse Club as a child. In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two lead vocalists and youngest member of NSYNC, which eventually became one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. Timberlake won two Grammy Awards for his R&B-focused debut solo album Justified (2002) and its single "Cry Me a River". Another single from the album, "Rock Your Body", was also successful.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His critically acclaimed sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006), characterized by its diversity in music genres, debuted atop the U.S. Billboard 200 and produced the Hot 100 number-one singles "SexyBack", "My Love", and "What Goes Around... Comes Around". Established as a solo artist worldwide, his first two albums both exceeded sales of 10 million copies, and he continued producing records and collaborating with other artists. From 2008 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus. He held starring roles in the films The Social Network, Bad Teacher, Friends with Benefits, and In Time.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timberlake resumed his music career in 2013 with his third and fourth albums The 20/20 Experience and The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2, exploring neo soul styles, partly inspired by the expansive song structures of 1960s and 1970s rock. The former became the best-selling album of the year with the largest sales week in the US, and spawned the top-three singles "Suit & Tie" and "Mirrors", while the latter produced the top-ten song "Not a Bad Thing". For his live performances, including the eponymous concert tour for the albums, he began performing with his band The Tennessee Kids, composed by instrumentalists and dancers. Timberlake voiced Branch in DreamWorks Animation's Trolls (2016), whose soundtrack includes his fifth Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping single, "Can't Stop the Feeling!". His fifth studio album Man of the Woods (2018) became his fourth number-one album in the US. Supported by the two top ten singles, "Filthy" and "Say Something", it concluded 2018 as the sixth best-selling album of the year. In May 2019, Timberlake received an honorary Doctorate from Berklee College of Music.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being one of the world's best-selling music artists, Timberlake has sold over 32 million albums and 56 million singles globally throughout his solo career. Often regarded as a pop icon, Timberlake is the recipient of numerous awards and accolades, including ten Grammy Awards, four Emmy Awards, three Brit Awards, nine Billboard Music Awards, the Contemporary Icon Award by the Songwriters Hall of Fame, an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the Berklee College of Music, and the 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-justin-timberlake');toggle_visibility('ma-michael-jackson');">
				<b><p2>Michael Jackson</p2></b>
			</a> Video Vanguard Award. According to Billboard in 2017, he is the best performing male soloist in the history of the Mainstream Top 40. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2007 and 2013. His other ventures include record label Tennman Records, fashion label William Rast, and the restaurants Destino and Southern Hospitality.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanye Omari West is an American rapper, record producer, and fashion designer. He has been influential in the 21st-century development of mainstream hip hop and popular music in general.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West was first known as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing singles for several mainstream artists. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to critical and commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music. He experimented with a variety of musical genres on subsequent acclaimed studio albums, including Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), and 808s & Heartbreak (2008). Drawing inspiration from maximalism and minimalism, respectively, West's fifth album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010) and sixth album Yeezus (2013) were also critical successes. He went on to release The Life of Pablo (2016), Ye (2018), and Jesus Is King (2019). West's discography also includes the full-length collaborations Watch the Throne (2011) and Kids See Ghosts (2018) with 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-kanye-west');">
				<b><p2>Jay-Z</p2></b>
			</a> and Kid Cudi, respectively.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West's outspoken views and life outside of music have received significant media attention. He has been a frequent source of controversy for his conduct at award shows, on social media, and in other public settings, as well as for his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, and race. In July 2020, he launched an ongoing independent presidential campaign. His Christian faith, as well as his marriage to television personality Kim Kardashian, have also been a source of media attention. As a fashion designer, he has collaborated with Nike, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. on both clothing and footwear, and have most prominently resulted in the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas beginning in 2013. He is the founder and head of the creative content company DONDA.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with more than 20 million albums and 140 million singles sold worldwide. He has won a total of 21 Grammy Awards, making him one of the most awarded artists of all time. Among his other awards include the Billboard Artist Achievement Award, a joint-record three Brit Awards for Best International Male Solo Artist and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. Six of his albums have been included on Rolling Stone's 2020 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list; the same publication named him one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.[12] West is the tied holder for the most albums (four) topping the annual Pazz & Jop critic poll. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2015.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keith Douglas Sweat (born July 22, 1961) is an American singer, songwriter, and an early figure in the new jack swing musical movement. He is known for his collection of hits including "I Want Her", "Make It Last Forever", "I'll Give All My Love to You", "Make You Sweat", "Get Up on It", "Twisted" and "Nobody". He has released 13 solo albums and 2 as a part of the R&B supergroup LSG, and discovered the groups Silk and Kut Klose.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweat started his musical career as a member of a Harlem band called Jamilah in 1975. With the help of Jamilah, Sweat was able to hone his craft as a lead singer by performing regionally throughout the tri-State area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The group was started by bassist Larry Peoples, guitarist Michael Samuels, and drummer Walter Bradley.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweat released his fourth album Get Up on It in the summer of 1994, and his self-titled fifth album in 1996. Both albums reached the top ten on the Billboard 200. The single co/produced and written by Eric McCaine "Twisted" featuring R&B group Kut Klose hit No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and "Nobody" hit No. 3, which made them Sweat's biggest hits to date. "Just A Touch" was a cover of the 1979 song "Just a Touch of Love" by Slave. In the fall of 1997, Sweat discovered the group Ol' Skool and helped with their self-titled debut. He was on their biggest single, "Am I Dreaming," which featured the R&B group Xscape. Sweat also formed the R&B supergroup LSG with Gerald Levert and Johnny Gill, and released their self-titled debut album Levert.Sweat.Gill in 1997. That album featured "My Body", which became a hit single. The album was certified double platinum and reached No. 4 on the U.S. Billboard 200.

As a child, Lamar attended McNair Elementary and Vanguard Learning Center in the Compton Unified School District. He has admitted to being quiet and shy in school, his mother even confirming he was a "loner" until the age of seven. As a teenager, he attended Centennial Middle School in Compton, where he was a straight-A student.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raised in Compton, California, Lamar embarked on his musical career as a teenager under the stage name K-Dot, releasing a mixtape that garnered local attention and led to his signing with indie record label Top Dawg Entertainment. He began to gain recognition in 2010 after his first retail release, Overly Dedicated. The following year, he independently released his first studio album, Section.80, which included his debut single "HiiiPoWeR". By that time, he had amassed a large online following and collaborated with several prominent hip hop artists.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamar's major label debut album, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City, was released in 2012 to critical acclaim. It was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His third album To Pimp a Butterfly (2015) incorporated elements of funk, soul, jazz, and spoken word. It became his first number one album on the Billboard 200, and was the most acclaimed album of the 2010s. It was followed by Untitled Unmastered (2016), a collection of unreleased demos that originated during the recording sessions for To Pimp a Butterfly. He released his fourth album, Damn (2017) to further acclaim; its lead single "Humble" topped the US Billboard Hot 100, while the album became the first non-classical and non-jazz album to be awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music. In 2018, he wrote and produced 14 songs for the soundtrack to the superhero film Black Panther, which also received critical acclaim.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lamar has received many accolades over the course of his career, including 13 Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards, five Billboard Music Awards, a Brit Award, 11 MTV Video Music Awards, a Pulitzer Prize, and an Academy Award nomination. In 2012, MTV named him the Hottest MC in the Game on their annual list. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2016.[7] In 2015, he received the California State Senate's Generational Icon Award. Three of his studio albums have been listed in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (2020).

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1969 or 1970) is an American singer-songwriter and actress. Known for her five-octave vocal range, melismatic singing style, and signature use of the whistle register, she is referred to as the "Songbird Supreme" by Guinness World Records. She rose to fame in 1990 with her eponymous debut album, released under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola, who married her three years later. Carey is the first artist in history to have their first five singles reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100, from "Vision of Love" to "Emotions".
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She achieved worldwide success with follow-up albums Music Box (1993), Merry Christmas (1994), and Daydream (1995). These albums spawned some of Carey's most successful singles, including "Hero", "Without You", "All I Want for Christmas Is You", "Fantasy", "Always Be My Baby", as well as "One Sweet Day", which topped the US Billboard Hot 100 decade-end chart (1990s). After separating from Mottola, Carey adopted a new image and incorporated more elements of hip hop into her music with the release of Butterfly (1997). Billboard named her the country's most successful artist of the 1990s, while the World Music Awards honored her as the world's best-selling music artist of the 1990s, and the best-selling female artist of the millennium.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After eleven consecutive years charting a US number-one single, Carey parted ways with Columbia in 2001 and signed a $80 million recording contract with Virgin Records in April of that year. However, following her highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown, as well as the critical and commercial failure of her film Glitter (2001) and its accompanying soundtrack, her contract was bought out for $28 million by Virgin and she signed with Island Records the following year. After a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to the top of music charts with The Emancipation of Mimi (2005), the world's second-best-selling album of 2005. Its second single, "We Belong Together", topped the US Billboard Hot 100 decade-end chart (2000s). Her performance the 2009 film Precious won her the Breakthrough Actress Performance Award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance techniques such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, and popularized the robot. His sound and style have influenced artists of various genres, and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. Jackson is the most awarded artist in the history of popular music.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records, and rose to solo stardom with his fifth studio album Off the Wall (1979) during the peak of the disco era. By the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. His music videos, including those for "Beat It", "Billie Jean", and "Thriller" from his sixth studio album Thriller (1982), are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. Jackson's prominence propelled him and the television channel MTV into cultural phenomenons of 1980s pop culture. At the 1984 Grammy Awards, Thriller won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. Jackson continued to innovate with videos on the global best-seller albums Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991) and HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995).
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting in the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of court, and Jackson was not indicted. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. Four years later, while preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray. Fans around the world expressed their grief, and Jackson's public memorial service was broadcast live. In August 2009, the Los Angeles County Coroner ruled that Jackson's death was a homicide, and Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in November 2011. Seven years later, the documentary Leaving Neverland, which detailed posthumous allegations of child sexual abuse, led to another media backlash against Jackson, while also inspiring the release of accounts countering the allegations.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 350 million records worldwide.[nb 1] Thriller is the best-selling album of all time, with estimated sales of 66 million copies worldwide. In addition, the remix album Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix (1997) is the best-selling remix album of all time. Bad was the first album to produce five Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles.[nb 2] Jackson had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles, more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era, and was also the first artist to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. He received 13 Grammy Awards, the Grammy Legend and Grammy Lifetime Achievement awards, six Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and 39 Guinness World Records, including the "Most Successful Entertainer of All Time". Jackson's inductions include the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Dance Hall of Fame (the only recording artist to be inducted), and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame. In 2016, his estate earned $825 million, the highest yearly amount for a celebrity ever recorded by Forbes.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motown played an important role in the racial integration of popular music as an African American-owned label that achieved crossover success. In the 1960s, Motown and its subsidiary labels (including Tamla Motown, the brand used outside the US) were the most successful proponents of the Motown sound, a style of soul music with a mainstream pop appeal. Motown was the most successful soul music label, with a net worth of $61 million. During the 1960s, Motown achieved 79 records in the top-ten of the Billboard Hot 100 between 1960 and 1969.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the events of the Detroit Riots of 1967 and the loss of key songwriting/production team Holland–Dozier–Holland the same year over pay disputes, Gordy relocated Motown to Los Angeles, California. Motown expanded into film and television production, remaining an independent company until 1988, when it was sold to MCA Records. PolyGram purchased the label from MCA in 1993, followed by MCA successor Universal Music Group when it acquired PolyGram in 1999.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motown spent much of the 2000s headquartered in New York City as a part of the UMG subsidiaries Universal Motown and Universal Motown Republic Group. From 2011 to 2014, it was a part of The Island Def Jam Music Group division of Universal Music. In 2014, however, UMG announced the dissolution of Island Def Jam, and Motown relocated back to Los Angeles to operate under the Capitol Music Group, now operating out of the Capitol Tower. In 2018, Motown was inducted into Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in a ceremony held at the Charles H. Wright Museum.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taalib Johnson, professionally known as Musiq Soulchild or simply Musiq (pronounced just like "music") is an American singer and songwriter whose style blends R&B, funk, blues, jazz, gospel influences fused with hip hop.
			<br><br>
			Musiq was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and raised in a strict Muslim household. During his teenage years he built a reputation for being musically gifted, beat boxing for MCs free styling on the open mic circuit, scatting at jazz clubs or just performing an a cappella for strangers on the streets, which is where he got the name "Musiq" and later added "Soulchild". He cites as his inspiration such icons as

				<b><p2>Marvin Gaye,</p2></b>
			</a>
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-musiq-soulchild');toggle_visibility('ma-stevie-wonder');">
				<b><p2>Stevie Wonder,</p2></b>
			</a> and Donny Hathaway as his most influential musical icons. He dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fifth album OnMyRadio was released on December 2, 2008. The lead single "Radio" was a complete contrast to the usual smooth neo soul Musiq fans were accustomed to. The following singles were the duet IfULeave featuring 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-musiq-soulchild');toggle_visibility('ma-mary-j-blige');">
				<b><p2>Mary J. Blige;</p2></b>
			</a> and the ballad SoBeautiful. "SoBeautiful" marked the first collaboration between Musiq and the producer JR Hutson, after Hutson had spent "about eight months" trying to get Musiq to come by his studio. According to Hutson, the two plan to work together again.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher George Latore Wallace (May 21, 1972 – March 9, 1997), better known by his stage names The Notorious B.I.G., Biggie Smalls, or simply Biggie, was an American rapper and songwriter. Rooted in the New York rap scene and gangsta rap traditions, he is considered one of the greatest rappers of all time. The Notorious B.I.G. became known for his distinctive laidback lyrical delivery, offsetting the lyrics' often grim content and his own intimidating appearance. His music was often semi-autobiographical, telling of hardship and criminality, but also of debauchery and celebration.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City, the Notorious B.I.G. signed to Sean "Puffy" Combs' label Bad Boy Records as it launched in 1993, and gained exposure through features on several other artists' singles that year. His debut album Ready to Die (1994) was met with widespread critical acclaim, and included his signature songs "Juicy" and "Big Poppa". The album made him the central figure in East Coast hip hop, and restored New York's visibility at a time when the West Coast hip hop scene was dominating hip hop music. The Notorious B.I.G. was awarded the 1995 Billboard Music Awards' Rapper of the Year. The following year, he led his protégé group Junior M.A.F.I.A., a team of himself and longtime friends, including Lil' Kim, to chart success.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 1996, while recording his second album, the Notorious B.I.G. became ensnarled in the escalating East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud. Following 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-notorious-big');toggle_visibility('ma-2pac');">
				<b><p2>Tupac Shakur's</p2></b>
			</a> death in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in September 1996, speculations of involvement by criminal elements orbiting the Bad Boy circle circulated. On March 9, 1997, while visiting Los Angeles, Wallace was murdered in a drive-by shooting. The assailant remains unidentified. The Notorious B.I.G.'s second album Life After Death, a double album, was released two weeks later. It reached number one on the Billboard 200, and eventually achieved a Diamond certification in the US.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With two more posthumous albums released, the Notorious B.I.G. has accrued certified sales of over 28 million copies in the United States, including 21 million albums. Rolling Stone has called him the "greatest rapper that ever lived," and Billboard named him the greatest rapper of all time. The Source magazine named him the greatest rapper of all time in its 150th issue. In 2006, MTV ranked him at No. 3 on their list of The Greatest MCs of All Time, calling him possibly "the most skillful ever on the mic". In 2020, the Notorious B.I.G. will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ohio Players were an American funk band, most popular in the 1970s. They are best known for their songs "Fire" and "Love Rollercoaster"; as well as for their erotic album covers that featured nude or nearly nude women. Many of the women were models featured in Playboy.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The singles "Funky Worm", "Skin Tight", "Fire", and "Love Rollercoaster"; as well as their albums Skin Tight, Fire, and Honey, were awarded Gold certifications.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August 17, 2013, Ohio Players were inducted into the inaugural class of the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame that took place at Cleveland State University in Cleveland, Ohio.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The band formed in Dayton, Ohio, United States, in 1959 as the Ohio Untouchables and initially included members Robert Ward[3] (vocals/guitar), Marshall "Rock" Jones (bass), Clarence "Satch" Satchell (saxophone/guitar), Cornelius Johnson (drums), and Ralph "Pee Wee" Middlebrooks (trumpet/trombone). They were best known at the time as a backing group for The Falcons.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ward had proved to be an unreliable leader, who would sometimes walk off the stage during gigs, forcing the group to stop playing. Eventually, the group vowed to keep playing even after he left. Ward and Jones got into a fistfight in 1964, after which the group broke up.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ward found new backups, and the group's core members returned to Dayton. They replaced Ward with 21-year-old Leroy "Sugarfoot" Bonner (guitar), who would become the group's front man, and added Gregory Webster (drums). To accommodate Bonner's musical style preferences for the group ("R&B with a little flair to it") and to avoid competing with Ward, the group changed their format. By 1965, the group had renamed themselves the Ohio Players, reflecting its members' self-perceptions as musicians and as ladies' men.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheatham was born in Detroit, Michigan. Encouraged by his mother to sing, over the years he joined several local groups including The Young Sirs, Mad Dog and the Pups and Gaslight before releasing a single, "Hard Times" on the Tier record label. He then joined another group, the Sins of Satan, the group later being renamed as Roundtrip. They finally took Cheatham's first name and recorded two albums as Oliver.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheatham then signed for MCA Records as a solo singer. He worked with Al Hudson of the band One Way on his first album, The Boss. His first chart success came in 1983 with "Get Down Saturday Night", co-written by Cheatham and One Way's Kevin McCord, which reached no.37 on the Billboard R&B chart, and also reached no.38 on the UK singles chart. The album, Saturday Night, produced by Al Perkins, was released the same year. In 1986, he moved to the Critique label, and had further success in the US with the singles "S.O.S." (R&B chart no.35), and "Celebrate (Our Love)". Other Cheatham singles included "Mama Said," "Put a Little Love in Your Heart," "Things to Make U Happy," and "Wish on a Star." After moving to the New York-based Warlock label, he recorded "Turn Out the Lights" and "Mindbuster" with Jocelyn Brown. He spent much of the 1990s working as a backing singer with artists including Leo Sayer, and released his final album, Stand for Love, in 2002.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the charts in 2003, when he was featured in Room 5's UK #1 single, "Make Luv", which sampled "Get Down Saturday Night", though Cheatham re-recorded his vocal parts for later releases. The track was featured on a commercial for Lynx deodorant on British TV. Its success in the UK led Cheatham to relocate to Surrey, England, and he recorded in London for the Native Soul record label.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elements of "Get Down Saturday Night" were also used in Michael Gray's 2004 hit, "The Weekend". It also featured in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Ex Machina. The track was also sampled for Lino di Meglio's 2013 song "I Can't Live Without (Dino In Paris Full Vox)".
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheatham died on November 29, 2013, at the age of 65, following a heart attack in his sleep.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outkast (stylized as OutKast) were an American hip hop duo formed in 1992 in East Point, Georgia, consisting of Atlanta-based rappers André "3000" Benjamin (formerly known as Dré) and Antwan "Big Boi" Patton. Widely recognized for their intricate lyricism, memorable melodies and positive messages, OutKast is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential hip hop duos of all time. The duo achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, helping to popularize Southern hip hop while experimenting with diverse genres such as funk, psychedelia, jazz, and techno.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin and Patton formed the group as high school students in 1992. Outkast released their debut album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik in 1994, which gained popularity after the single "Player's Ball" reached number one on the Billboard Hot Rap Tracks chart. With successive releases including ATLiens (1996) and Aquemini (1998), the duo further developed their sound, experimenting with a variety of styles and achieving commercial success. In 2000, Outkast released the critically acclaimed Stankonia, which included the singles "Ms. Jackson" and "B.O.B."
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September 2003, the duo released the double album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which featured the number one singles "Hey Ya!" and "The Way You Move." The album won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America. Outkast next released the soundtrack for the 2006 musical film Idlewild, which they also starred in. In 2007, the duo went on hiatus and both members have since pursued solo careers. In 2014, Outkast reunited to celebrate their 20th anniversary by performing at more than 40 festivals worldwide, beginning at the Coachella Festival in April.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duo is one of the most successful hip hop groups of all time, having received six Grammy Awards. Rolling Stone ranked them No. 7 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time. Between six studio albums and a greatest hits release, Outkast has sold over 25 million records. Meanwhile, they have garnered widespread critical acclaim, with publications such as Rolling Stone and Pitchfork Media listing albums such as Aquemini and Stankonia among the best of their era.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellis was born Alfred James Ellis on April 21, 1941 in Bradenton, Florida to his mother Elizabeth and his father Garfield Devoe Rogers, Jr. In 1949 his mother married Ezell Ellis, and the family moved to Lubbock, Texas where Ellis was given his nickname "Pee Wee". He gave his first public performance in 1954 at Dunbar Junior High School. After Ezell Ellis was killed in 1955, the remaining members of the family moved to Rochester, New York. While attending Madison High School he played professionally with jazz musicians including Ron Carter and Chuck Mangione. In 1957 he moved to New York City, where he attended Manhattan School of Music and had regular lessons with Sonny Rollins. In 1960 he moved back to Florida working as a bandleader, musical director and writer.

			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1979 and 1986 he worked with Van Morrison's band as an arranger and musical director and then again from 1995 through 1999. He also gave occasional performances in 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 2000, 2002, 2005 and 2006 as guest appearances.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharrell Lanscilo Williams is an American singer, rapper, songwriter, record producer, fashion designer, and entrepreneur. With close friend Chad Hugo, he formed the hip hop and R&B production duo The Neptunes in the early 1990s, with whom he has produced songs for various recording artists. In 1999, he became the lead vocalist of the band N.E.R.D., which he formed with Hugo and Shay Haley.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams released his debut solo single, "Frontin'", in 2003. His debut solo album, In My Mind, followed in 2006. In 2013, Williams was featured on the song "Blurred Lines" alongside Robin Thicke and T.I., and his song "Happy" was the lead single for the soundtrack of the film Despicable Me 2. In the same year, Williams was featured on Daft Punk's single "Get Lucky", which won Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 56th Grammy Awards. Williams' second album, Girl, was released in 2014.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams has received numerous accolades and nominations.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 – April 21, 2016) was an American singer-songwriter, musician, record producer, dancer, actor, and filmmaker. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest musicians of his generation. A multi-instrumentalist who was considered a guitar virtuoso, he was well known for his eclectic work across multiple genres, flamboyant and androgynous persona, and wide vocal range which included a far-reaching falsetto and high-pitched screams.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prince's innovative music integrated a wide variety of styles, including funk, R&B, rock, new wave, soul, synth-pop, psychedelia, pop, industrial, and hip hop. He pioneered the Minneapolis sound, a funk rock subgenre that emerged in the late 1970s. He was also known for his prolific output, releasing 39 albums during his life, with a vast array of unreleased projects left in a vault at his home after his death; it is believed that the vault contains dozens of fully produced albums and over 50 music videos that have never been released, along with various other media. He released hundreds of songs both under his own name and multiple pseudonyms during his life, as well as writing songs that were made famous by other musicians, such as "Nothing Compares 2 U" and "Manic Monday". Estimates of the complete number of songs written by Prince range anywhere from 500 to well over 1,000.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Prince signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records at the age of 19. Prince went on to achieve critical success with the innovative albums Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982). Working with his backup band the Revolution, his sixth album Purple Rain (1984), which was the soundtrack to his film acting debut of the same name, spent six consecutive months atop the Billboard 200.[5] Prince won the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. After disbanding the Revolution, Prince went on to achieve continued critical success with Sign o' the Times (1987). In the midst of a contractual dispute with Warner Bros. in 1993, he changed his stage name to the unpronounceable symbol Logo. Hollow circle above downward arrow crossed with a curlicued horn-shaped symbol and then a short bar (known to fans as the "Love Symbol"), and was sometimes referred to as the Artist Formerly Known as Prince or simply the Artist. He signed with Arista Records in 1998 and began referring to himself by his own name again in 2000. After returning to mainstream prominence following a performance at the Grammy Awards ceremony in 2004, he scored six US top ten albums over the following decade. Joni Mitchell said of Prince, "He's driven like an artist. His motivations are growth and experimentation as opposed to formula and hits."
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sold over 130 million records worldwide, ranking him among the best-selling music artists of all time. His awards included the Grammy President's Merit Award, the American Music Awards for Achievement and of Merit, the Billboard Icon Award, an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2016.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) and John Deacon (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name "Queen". Deacon was recruited in February 1971, before the band released their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured "Bohemian Rhapsody", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The band's 1977 album News of the World contained "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions", which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. "Another One Bites the Dust" from The Game (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album Greatest Hits is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified eight times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at Knebworth, England. In 1991, he died of bronchopneumonia—a complication of AIDS—and Deacon retired in 1997. Since 2004, May and Taylor have toured under the "Queen +" name with vocalists Paul Rodgers and Adam Lambert.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates of Queen's record sales range from 170 million to 300 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. In 1990, Queen received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music from the British Phonographic Industry. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001. Each member has composed hit singles, and all four were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2005, Queen received the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. In 2018, they were presented the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles Robinson (September 23, 1930 – June 10, 2004) was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, and composer. Among friends and fellow musicians he preferred being called "Brother Ray." He was often referred to as "The Genius." Charles was blinded during childhood due to glaucoma.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles pioneered the soul music genre during the 1950s by combining blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and gospel styles into the music he recorded for Atlantic. He contributed to the integration of country music, rhythm and blues, and pop music during the 1960s with his crossover success on ABC Records, notably with his two Modern Sounds albums.While he was with ABC, Charles became one of the first black musicians to be granted artistic control by a mainstream record company.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles' 1960 hit "Georgia On My Mind" was the first of his three career No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. His 1962 album Modern Sounds In Country And Western Music became his first album to top the Billboard 200. Charles had multiple singles reach the Top 40 on various Billboard charts: 44 on the US R&B singles chart, 11 on the Hot 100 singles chart, 2 on the Hot Country singles charts.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles cited Nat King Cole as a primary influence, but his music was also influenced by Louis Jordan and Charles Brown. He had a lifelong friendship and occasional partnership with

			</a> Frank Sinatra called Ray Charles "the only true genius in show business," although Charles downplayed this notion. Billy Joel said, "This may sound like sacrilege, but I think Ray Charles was more important than Elvis Presley".
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his musical contributions, Charles received the Kennedy Center Honors, the National Medal of Arts, and the Polar Music Prize. He won 17 Grammy Awards, including 5 posthumously. Charles was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987, and 10 of his recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.[10] Rolling Stone ranked Charles No. 10 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and No. 2 on their list of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, her autobiography, Confessions of a Difficult Woman, co-written with music journalist Ed Nimmervoll, was published. In her candid book, Geyer detailed her drug addictions, sex life and career in music. She described herself as "a white Hungarian Jew from Australia sounding like a 65-year-old black man from Alabama". She spent more than ten years based in the United States but had little chart success there under her own name, yet contributing to releases by Neil Diamond, Men at Work, Sting, Trouble Funk and many others. Geyer returned to Australia in the mid-1990s and her career has continued into the 21st century with her 2003 album, Tenderland, which peaked at #11 on the ARIA albums charts.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock historian Ian McFarlane described her as having a "rich, soulful, passionate and husky vocal delivery". Geyer's iconic status in the Australian music industry was recognised when she was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame on 14 July 2005, alongside The Easybeats, Hunters & Collectors, Smoky Dawson, Split Enz and Normie Rowe. Geyer and fellow 1970s singer, Marcia Hines, are the subjects of Australian academic, Jon Stratton's 2008 Cultural Studies article, "A Jew Singing Like a Black Woman in Australia: Race, Renée Geyer, and Marcia Hines".

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Ambrose Johnson Jr. (February 1, 1948 – August 6, 2004), better known by his stage name Rick James, was an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer. Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, James began his musical career in his teen years. He was in various bands before entering the U.S. Navy to avoid being drafted into the army. In 1964, James deserted to Toronto, Canada, where he formed the rock band the Mynah Birds, who eventually signed a recording deal with 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-rick-james');toggle_visibility('ma-motown');">
				<b><p2>Motown</p2></b>
			</a> Records in 1966. James' career with the group halted after military authorities discovered his whereabouts and eventually convicted and sentenced James to a one-year prison term related to the desertion charges. After being released, James moved to California, where he started a variety of rock and funk groups in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After forming the locally popular Stone City Band in his hometown of Buffalo in 1977, James finally found success as a recording artist after signing with Motown's Gordy Records, releasing the album Come Get It! in 1978 which produced the hits "You & I" and "Mary Jane". In 1981, James released his most successful album, Street Songs, which included career-defining hits such as "Give It to Me Baby" and "Super Freak", the latter song becoming his biggest crossover single, mixing elements of funk, disco, rock and new wave. James was also known for his soulful ballads such as "Fire & Desire" and "Ebony Eyes". In addition, James also had a successful career as a songwriter and producer for other artists including 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-rick-james');toggle_visibility('ma-teena-marie');">
				<b><p2>Teena Marie,</p2></b>
			</a> the Mary Jane Girls, the Temptations, Eddie Murphy and Smokey Robinson.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James' mainstream success had peaked with the release of his album Glow in 1985 and his appearance on the popular TV show, The A-Team. His subsequent album releases failed to sell as well as their predecessors. Rapper MC Hammer sampled James' "Super Freak" for his 1990 hit, "U Can't Touch This" which won Best R&B Song at the 1991 Grammy Awards. James received his only Grammy for composing the song. By the early 1990s, James' career was hampered by his drug addiction and he was embroiled with legal issues. In 1993, James was convicted for two separate instances of kidnapping and torturing two different women while under the influence of crack cocaine, resulting in a three-year sentence at Folsom State Prison. James was released on parole in 1996 and released the album Urban Rapsody in 1997. James's health problems halted his career again after he had a mild stroke during a concert in 1998, and he announced a semi-retirement.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, James's career returned to mainstream pop culture after he appeared in an episode of Chappelle's Show. The segment involved a Charlie Murphy True Hollywood Stories–style skit that satirized James' wild lifestyle in the 1980s. This resulted in renewed interest in his music and that year he returned to perform on the road. James died later that year from heart failure at age 56.

Roger used a custom-made talkbox–the Electro Harmonix "Golden Throat," through a Moog Minimoog and later in his career a Yamaha DX100 FM synthesizer. As both band leader of

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helen Folasade Adu CBE (Yoruba: Fọláṣadé Adú [fɔ̄láʃādé ādú]; born January 16, 1959), known professionally as Sade Adu or simply Sade, is an English singer, songwriter, and actress, known as the lead singer of her eponymous band. She has been credited as one of the most successful British female artists in history, and is often recognised as an influence on contemporary music. Her services to music were also recognised with an award of the Officer of the Order of the British Empire chivalry honour in 2002, and later the rank of the Commander of the same order in 2017.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in Ibadan, Nigeria, but brought up partly in Essex, England, Sade gained modest recognition as a fashion designer and part-time model, prior to joining the band Pride in the early 1980s. After gaining attention as a performer, she formed the band Sade, and secured a recording contract with Epic Records in 1983. A year later the band released the album Diamond Life, which became one of the best-selling albums of the era, and the best-selling debut ever by a British female vocalist. In July 1985, Sade was among the performers at the Live Aid charity concert at Wembley Stadium, and the following year she appeared in the film Absolute Beginners. Following the band's third and fourth albums, Stronger Than Pride (1988) and Love Deluxe (1992), they went on hiatus after the birth of Sade's child, while the singer experienced widespread media coverage during the period for unsubstantiated claims of mental health and addiction issues.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a spell of eight years without an album, the band reunited in 1999, and released Lovers Rock in 2000. The album departed from the jazz-inspired inflections of their previous work, featuring mellower sounds and pop compositions. The band then underwent another hiatus, not producing music for another ten years until the release of Soldier of Love. Following that album's release, the band entered a third period of hiatus, and have only released two new songs (2018's "Flower of the Universe" for the soundtrack of Disney's A Wrinkle in Time and "The Big Unknown", part of the soundtrack for Steve McQueen's film Widows) to date.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday Night Fever is a 1977 American dance drama film directed by John Badham. It stars John Travolta as Tony Manero, a working-class young man who spends his weekends dancing and drinking at a local Brooklyn discothèque; Karen Lynn Gorney as Stephanie Mangano, his dance partner and eventual confidante; and Donna Pescow as Annette, Tony's former dance partner and would-be girlfriend. While in the disco, Tony is the champion dancer. His circle of friends and weekend dancing help him to cope with the harsh realities of his life: a dead-end job, clashes with his unsupportive and squabbling parents, racial tensions in the local community, and his general restlessness.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story is based upon a 1976 New York magazine article by British writer Nik Cohn, "Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night"; in the mid-1990s, Cohn acknowledged that he fabricated the article. A newcomer to the United States and a stranger to the disco lifestyle, Cohn was unable to make any sense of the subculture he had been assigned to write about; instead, the character who became Tony Manero was based on an English mod acquaintance of Cohn.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday Night Fever was a huge commercial success and had a tremendous effect on popular culture of the late 1970s. The film significantly helped to popularize disco music around the world and made Travolta, already well known from his role on TV's Welcome Back, Kotter, a household name; he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance. The Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, featuring disco songs by the 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-saturday-night-fever');toggle_visibility('ma-bee-gees');">
				<b><p2>Bee Gees,</p2></b>
			</a> is one of the best-selling soundtracks of all time. The film showcased aspects of the music, the dancing, and the subculture surrounding the disco era: symphony-orchestrated melodies; haute couture styles of clothing; pre-AIDS sexual promiscuity; and graceful choreography. A sequel, Staying Alive, also starring Travolta, was released six years later, but was panned by critics. In 2010, Saturday Night Fever was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-shalamar');toggle_visibility('ma-soul-train');">
				<b><p2>Soul Train</p2></b>
			</a> dancers Jody Watley and Jeffrey Daniel, to join original Shalamar lead singer Gary Mumford. Gerald Brown took over the spot vacated by Mumford for the group's second album, Disco Gardens (1978), which featured the hit "Take That to the Bank". After conflicts over lack of payment from Griffey and SOLAR (short for Sound of Los Angeles Records), Brown left the group. Howard Hewett replaced Brown in 1979. The group was joined up with producer Leon Sylvers III in 1979, signed with SOLAR, and scored a US million seller with "The Second Time Around" (1979). The classic line up of Hewett, Watley and Daniel would be the most successful.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the UK, the group had a string of hits with songs such as "Take That to the Bank" (1978), "I Owe You One" (1980), and songs from the Friends (1982) album: "I Can Make You Feel Good" (1982), "A Night to Remember", "There It Is", and the title track "Friends". The album, which crossed the genres of pop, disco, and soul, was also a big seller in the UK in 1982. The band's record sales in the UK increased when Daniel demonstrated his body-popping dancing skills on BBC Television's music programme, Top of the Pops, which had premiered the Moonwalk on television for the first time.

Daniel and Jackson co-choreographed Jackson's "Bad" and "Smooth Criminal" videos from the album Bad (1987).

In 1979, they released their breakthrough album We Are Family, which peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and included the 1979 US top-10 singles "He's the Greatest Dancer" and "We Are Family". A third single, "Lost in Music", reached the US top 40. "We Are Family" earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their other US singles include a 1982 remake of Mary Wells' 1964 hit "My Guy", "Mama Never Told Me" (1973), and "Thinking of You" (1984), before reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart with the song "Frankie" in 1985. Remixed versions of three of their singles in 1993 returned them to the UK Top 20. Although Kathy undertook a solo career in 1989, she continued to tour with the group (with Kathy occasionally rejoining for one-off performances and several releases in the 1990s). In 2015, Sister Sledge performed for Pope Francis at the World Festival of Families in Philadelphia.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six60 is a five-piece New Zealand band that formed in 2008. Their self-titled debut album was released on 10 October 2011 on their own label Massive Entertainment. The album was produced and mixed by Tiki Taane and debuted at number one in the New Zealand charts and was certified gold within its first week of release. Their first two singles "Rise Up 2.0" and "Don't Forget Your Roots" reached number one and number two respectively on the RIANZ singles chart and were both certified double and triple platinum. In 2018 the band won five Vodafone New Zealand Music Awards and were the most streamed artist by New Zealanders on Spotify. On 23 February 2019, Six60 became the first New Zealand band to play a sold-out concert at the Western Springs Stadium, to a crowd of 50,000 fans.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six60 was formed in Dunedin; the founding members met while attending University of Otago. The band created their name from the street number of the house they lived at in Dunedin, 660 Castle Street. As Ji Fraser said, "That's where it all began. It was the beginning of everything. It was a place that meant so much to us."
			Their local following developed from Dunedin to other student hubs around the country such as Auckland, Waikato, Christchurch and Wellington.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six60's original EP, released in 2009, contained a track called "Someone to Be Around". This track was left off their debut album but remains one of their most popular songs.
			Six60 have a quadruple platinum number-one debut album with triple platinum-selling single "Don't Forget Your Roots", two double platinum-selling singles "Only to Be" and "Rise Up", two platinum-selling singles "Forever" and "Special", and one gold-selling single "Lost".
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In early March 2013 the band was featured on George FM Breakfast's 'Damn! I Wish I Was Your Cover' series covering Rudimental's "Feel the Love".
			In 2014, their song "Run for It" was featured on the trailer of ITV drama series Prey, starring John Simm.
			Chris uses a MOOG Voyager / Ernie Ball Musicman Sting Ray Bass. Matiu and Ji both play Fender Strats, while Marlon uses an MS2000 / Muse VIP / Fender Strat. Eli plays KDrums drums.

			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robinson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, and was awarded the 2016 Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for his lifetime contributions to popular music.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smokey Robinson was born to an African-American father and a mother of African-American and French ancestry into a poor family in the North End area of Detroit, Michigan, United States. His ancestry is part Nigerian, Scandinavian, Portuguese, and Cherokee. His uncle Claude gave him the nickname "Smokey Joe" when he was a child. He attended Northern High School, where he was above average academically and a keen athlete, though his main interest was music and he formed a doo-wop group named the Five Chimes. At one point, he and

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. (born October 20, 1971), known professionally as Snoop Dogg, previously Snoop Doggy Dogg, and briefly Snoop Lion,[note 1] is an American rapper and media personality. His fame dates to 1992 when he featured on Dr. Dre's debut solo single, "Deep Cover", and then on 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-snoop-dogg');toggle_visibility('ma-dr-dre');">
				<b><p2>Dre's</p2></b>
			</a> debut solo album, The Chronic. Snoop has since sold over 23 million albums in the United States and 35 million albums worldwide.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snoop's debut solo album, Doggystyle, produced by Dr. Dre, was released by Death Row Records in November 1993, and debuted at number one on the popular albums chart, the Billboard 200, and on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Selling 800,000 copies in its first week, Doggystyle was certified quadruple-platinum in 1994 and bore several hit singles, including "What's My Name?" and "Gin & Juice". In 1994, Death Row Records released a soundtrack, by Snoop, for the short film Murder Was the Case, starring Snoop. In 1996, his second album, Tha Doggfather, also debuted at number one on both charts, with "Snoop's Upside Ya Head" as the lead single. The next year, the album was certified double-platinum.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After leaving Death Row Records in January 1998, Snoop signed with No Limit Records, releasing three Snoop albums: Da Game is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told (1998), No Limit Top Dogg (1999), and Tha Last Meal (2000). In 2002, he signed with Priority/Capitol/EMI Records, releasing Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss. In 2004, he signed to Geffen Records, releasing his next three albums: R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece, then Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, and Ego Trippin'. Priority Records released his album Malice 'n Wonderland during 2009, followed by Doggumentary during 2011. Snoop Dogg has starred in motion pictures and hosted several television shows, including Doggy Fizzle Televizzle, Snoop Dogg's Father Hood, and Dogg After Dark. He also coaches a youth football league and high-school football team. In September 2009, EMI hired him as the chairman of a reactivated Priority Records.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2012, after a trip to Jamaica, Snoop announced a conversion to Rastafarianism and a new alias, Snoop Lion. As Snoop Lion he released a reggae album, Reincarnated, and a documentary film of the same name, about his Jamaican experience, in early 2013. His 13th studio album, Bush, was released in May 2015 and marked a return of the Snoop Dogg name. His 14th solo studio album, Coolaid, was released in July 2016. Snoop has 17 Grammy nominations without a win. In March 2016, the night before WrestleMania 32 in Arlington, Texas, he was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame, having made several appearances for the company, including as master of ceremonies during a match at WrestleMania XXIV. In 2018, Snoop announced that he was "a born-again Christian" and released his first gospel album, Bible of Love. On November 19, 2018, Snoop Dogg was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He released his seventeenth solo album, I Wanna Thank Me in 2019.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soul Train is an American music-dance television program which aired in syndication from October 2, 1971, to March 27, 2006. In its 35-year history, the show primarily featured performances by R&B, soul, dance/pop, and hip hop artists, although funk, jazz, disco, and gospel artists also appeared. The series was created by Don Cornelius, who also served as its first host and executive producer.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Production was suspended following the 2005–2006 season, with a rerun package (known as The Best of Soul Train) airing for two years subsequently. As a nod to Soul Train's longevity, the show's opening sequence during later seasons contained a claim that it was the "longest-running first-run, nationally syndicated program in American television history," with over 1,100 episodes produced from the show's debut through the 2005–2006 season. Despite the production hiatus, Soul Train held that superlative until 2016, when Entertainment Tonight surpassed it completing its 35th season. Among non-news programs, Wheel of Fortune surpassed that mark in 2018.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stevland Hardaway Morris (né Judkins; born May 13, 1950), known professionally as Stevie Wonder, is an American singer, songwriter, musician and record producer. A prominent figure in popular music during the second half of the 20th century, Wonder is one of the most successful songwriters and musicians. A virtual one-man band, his use of synthesizers and further electronic musical instruments during the 1970s reshaped the conventions of R&B. He also helped drive the genre into the album era, crafting his LPs as cohesive, consistent socially conscious statements with complex compositions. Wonder is often hailed as a "genius", and has been credited as a pioneer and influence to musicians of various genres including rhythm and blues, pop, soul, gospel, funk and jazz.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blind since shortly after his birth, Wonder was a child prodigy known as Little Stevie Wonder, leading him to sign with Motown's Tamla label at the age of 11. In 1963, the single "Fingertips" was a number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 when Wonder was 13, making him the youngest artist ever to top the chart. Wonder's critical success was at its peak in the 1970s. His "classic period" began in 1972 with the releases of Music of My Mind and Talking Book, the latter featuring "Superstition", which is one of the most distinctive and famous examples of the sound of the Hohner Clavinet keyboard. His works Innervisions (1973), Fulfillingness' First Finale (1974) and Songs in the Key of Life (1976) all won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, making him the tied-record holder for the most Album of the Year wins, with three. He is also the only artist to have won the award with three consecutive album releases.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonder's "classic period", which culminated in 1976, was noted for his funky style of playing on the keyboard, personal control of production, and series of songs integrated with one another to make a concept album. In 1979, Wonder made use of the early music sampler Computer Music Melodian through his composition of the soundtrack album Stevie Wonder's Journey Through "The Secret Life of Plants". It was also his first digital recording, and one of the earliest popular albums to use the technology, which Wonder used for all subsequent recordings. Wonder's 1970s albums are widely regarded by writers as very influential, as his pioneering stylistic approach to his music helped shaping the sound of pop music in the following decade.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supremes were an American female singing group and a premier act of Motown Records during the 1960s. Founded as The Primettes in Detroit, Michigan, in 1959, the Supremes were the most commercially successful of Motown's acts and are, to date, America's most successful vocal group[1] with 12 number one singles on the Billboard Hot 100. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, Holland–Dozier–Holland. At their peak in the mid-1960s, the Supremes rivaled the Beatles in worldwide popularity, and it is said that their success made it possible for future African American R&B and soul musicians to find mainstream success.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Florence Ballard, Mary Wilson,

			</a> and Betty McGlown, the original group, are all from the Brewster-Douglass public housing project in Detroit.[3] They formed the Primettes as the sister act to the Primes (with Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks, who went on to form the Temptations). Barbara Martin replaced McGlown in 1960, and the group signed with Motown the following year as The Supremes. Martin left the act in early 1962, and Ross, Ballard, and Wilson carried on as a trio.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the mid-1960s, the Supremes achieved mainstream success with Ross as lead singer and Holland-Dozier-Holland as its songwriting and production team. In 1967, 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-supremes');toggle_visibility('ma-motown');">

			</a> president Berry Gordy renamed the group Diana Ross & the Supremes, and replaced Ballard with Cindy Birdsong. In 1970, Ross left to pursue a solo career and was replaced by Jean Terrell and the group reverted to being The Supremes again. During the mid-1970s, the lineup changed with Lynda Laurence, Scherrie Payne and Susaye Greene joining until, after 18 years, the group disbanded in 1977.

			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SZA is a neo soul singer, whose music has been described as alternative R&B, with elements of soul, hip hop, minimalist R&B, cloud rap, witch house, and chillwave.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary Christine Brockert (March 5, 1956 – December 26, 2010), known professionally as Teena Marie, was an American singer-songwriter and producer. She was known by her childhood nickname Tina before taking the stage name Teena Marie and later acquired the nickname Lady Tee (sometimes spelled Lady T), given to her by her collaborator and friend,

			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was known for her distinctive soprano vocals, which caused many listeners to believe she was black. Her success in R&B and soul music, and loyalty to these genres would earn her the title Ivory Queen of Soul. She played rhythm guitar, keyboards, and congas. Teena Marie was a three-time Grammy Award nominee.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1976, Brockert (as the lead singer of a band she had assembled, which included long-time friend Mickey Boyce) gained an introduction to

				<b><p2>Motown.</p2></b>
			</a>
			The project was shelved, but label boss Berry Gordy, impressed with her singing but having no need for a musical group, decided to sign her as a solo act. Tina recorded unreleased material with a number of different producers over the next few years, before being spotted by labelmate 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-teena-marie');toggle_visibility('ma-rick-james');">
				<b><p2>Rick James,</p2></b>

				<b><p2>Diana Ross</p2></b>
			</a> but changed his mind and decided to work with Brockert, instead. The result was her debut album release, Wild and Peaceful. The album was, at one point, due to be credited to "Teena Tryson", but ultimately was put out under "Teena Marie", the name by which she would be known throughout her remaining career. It scored Teena Marie her first top-ten R&B hit, "I'm a Sucker for Your Love" (#8 R&B Singles Chart), a duet with James. Neither the album nor its packaging had her picture on it, and many radio programmers assumed she was black during the earliest months of her career. This myth was disproved when she performed her debut hit with James on

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sananda Francesco Maitreya (born Terence Trent Howard, March 15, 1962), better known by his former stage name Terence Trent D'Arby, is an American singer and songwriter who came to fame with his debut studio album, Introducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D'Arby (1987). The album included the singles "If You Let Me Stay", "Sign Your Name", "Dance Little Sister", and "Wishing Well"; "Wishing Well" became a number one hit.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D'Arby's debut solo album, Introducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D'Arby, released in July 1987, is his best-known commercial work. The album produced hits including "If You Let Me Stay", "Sign Your Name", "Dance Little Sister", and the number one hit "Wishing Well".
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D'Arby expressed a high opinion of his debut album, claiming that it was the most important album since the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper. After the comments leaked to US media outlets, he stated that most of what he said was exaggerated, but that it is sometimes necessary to "hit people over the head" to get their attention. The album earned him a Grammy Award in the category Best R&B Vocal Performance, Male (1989) and a BRIT Award for International Breakthrough Act, and he also received Grammy and 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-terence-trent-darby');toggle_visibility('ma-soul-train');">
				<b><p2>Soul Train</p2></b>
			</a> nominations for Best New Artist.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D'Arby's follow-up album was Neither Fish Nor Flesh (1989), which was not as successful as his debut had been. It took four more years and a move to Los Angeles until his next album, Symphony or Damn (1993), was released. The record contained the singles "Delicate" and "She Kissed Me". It peaked at No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart. In 1995, D'Arby released Vibrator, which was followed by a world tour.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tevin Jermod Campbell (born November 12, 1976) is an American singer, songwriter and actor. He performed gospel in his local church from an early age. Following an audition for jazz musician, Bobbi Humphrey, in 1988, Campbell was signed to Warner Bros. Records. In 1989, Campbell collaborated with Quincy Jones performing lead vocals for "Tomorrow" on Jones' album "Back on the Block" and released his Platinum-selling debut album, T.E.V.I.N.. The album included his highest-charting single to date, "Tell Me What You Want Me to Do", peaking at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. The debut album also included the singles "Alone With You" (produced by Al B. Sure and Kyle West, with background vocals by K-Ci and JoJo from Jodeci), and "Goodbye".
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His double-Platinum selling second album, I'm Ready, released in 1993, included two high-charting songs penned by Babyface; "Can We Talk" peaked at number 9 on the Hot 100 and number 1 on the Billboard R&B charts, and the album's title track "I'm Ready", which also peaked at number 9 on the Hot 100. In 1996, Campbell released his third album, Back to the World, which was not as commercially or critically successful as his first two releases. His fourth and most recent album, Tevin Campbell, was released in 1999, but, performed poorly on Billboard's album charts.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from music, Campbell commenced an acting career, by appearing in the sequel to Prince's Purple Rain named Graffiti Bridge and made guest appearances on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Moesha television programs, voiced fictional pop star Powerline in Disney's A Goofy Movie and was cast as Seaweed in the Broadway musical Hairspray in 2005.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Campbell earned 5 Grammy Award nominations, and he has certified sales of 4.5 million records in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Seeds are a musical group rooted in reggae from Wellington, New Zealand. Their rocksteady-influenced song "One By One" became an international hit when it was played in top ranked TV series Breaking Bad. Their music is a boundary-crossing sound fusion of big beat funk, dub, afro music, pop, rock and soul – and a large or small touch of original roots reggae (like it was played 1972–1985) or ragga is almost always present regardless musical style.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formed in 1998, The Black Seeds perform with eight members, with instruments including vocals, guitar, saxophone, trumpet, bass, drums, bongos, keyboard and wood block. Black Seeds first album, Keep on Pushing, was released 2001 when the band already had established themselves as a strong live act. Already very successful in New Zealand and popular in Australia, Europe and North & South America, their third album Into the Dojo (2007) introduced Black Seeds to the rest of the world. They have released five albums, a live album, and two remix albums. They have two double-platinum selling albums in New Zealand, and successful European album releases through the German-based Sonar Kollektiv label. In 2011 Black Seeds was described by Rolling Stone as "The Best Reggae band in the world right now".
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lead singer Barnaby Weir, the son of veteran radio broadcaster Dick Weir, is also associated with the side-projects Fly My Pretties and Flash Harry. Former band member Bret McKenzie is also a member of international award-winning comedy duo Flight of the Conchords, as well as playing the role of Figwit the elf in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The band released their 6th studio album "Fabric" in early September 2017.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group was originally a gospel outfit known as the Hutchinson Sunbeams who toured the gospel circuit with their father Joe Hutchinson. The Sunbeams sang on Jerry Van Dyke’s “Children’s Gospel” television show and also occasionally performed in the concert with Mahalia Jackson. They eventually became an R&B/Soul act with a popular following in their hometown of Chicago, Illinois. Soon being renamed as The Emotions, they signed with the Memphis-based Volt imprint of Stax Records in the late 60s. Under the production of Isaac Hayes and David Porter the group issued their 1969 debut album entitled So I Can Love You on Stax.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So I Can Love You" rose to no. 43 upon the Billboard Top R&B Albums chart. The album's title track got to No. 3 on the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart and No. 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Another single entitled "The Best Part Of A Love Affair" rose to no. 27 upon the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 1970, The Emotions released a single entitled "Heart Association." That song reached No. 29 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart. The girl group went on to release their sophomore LP entitled Untouched in 1972 upon Stax. A song from the album called "Show Me How" rose to No. 13 upon the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 1972, the girl group also released another single called "My Honey and Me." That song reached No. 18 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emotions then started to work on their third studio album entitled Songs of Innocence and Experience. This LP was due to be issued in 1973, but was eventually shelved. The girl group went on to appear in the 1973 feature film Wattstax, performing the song "Peace Be Still." The tune went on to be added to the movie's soundtrack. Wattstax was also nominated for a Golden Globe in the category of Best Documentary. With Stax becoming defunct in 1975, the group then left the record label altogether.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group then joined up with Columbia Records where an association with Maurice White of 
			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-the-emotions');toggle_visibility('ma-ewf');">
				<b><p2>Earth, Wind & Fire</p2></b>
			</a> brought them their greatest level of success. With White and Charles Stepney on production, The Emotions issued in 1976 their third studio album Flowers on Columbia Records. Flowers rose to No.5 upon the Billboard Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and No. 45 on the Billboard 200. The album was also certified Gold in the US by the RIAA. The LP's title track got to No. 16 on the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart. Another single called "I Don't Wanna Lose Your Love" rose to No. 4 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart and No. 13 on the Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart.

Although it did not hit the Hot 100, it soared to #4 R&B, and the album went gold. The song, and the band's musical output as a whole, became more P-Funk-esque, with expanded use of the synthesizers and spoken monologues within songs (see audio sample). The song "Steppin' (Out)" also reached the top 10 R&B.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The band reached a whole new level of fame in 1980 with the release of the #1 R&B and #16 Billboard 200 hit, The Gap Band III. That album had soul ballads such as the #5 R&B song "Yearning for Your Love", and funk songs such as the R&B chart-topper "Burn Rubber on Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)" and "Humpin'". They repeated this formula on the #1 R&B album Gap Band IV in 1982 (the first album released on Simmons' newly launched Total Experience Records), which resulted in three hit singles: "Early in the Morning" (#1 R&B, #13 Dance, #24 Hot 100), "You Dropped a Bomb on Me" (#2 R&B, #31 Hot 100, #39 Dance), and "Outstanding" (#1 R&B, #24 Dance). It was during this time that former Brides of Funkenstein singer Dawn Silva joined them on tour.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their 1983 album, Gap Band V: Jammin', went gold, but was not quite as successful as the previous works, peaking at #2 R&B and #28 on the Billboard 200. The single "Party Train" peaked at #3 R&B, and the song "Jam the Motha'" peaked at #16 R&B, but neither made it onto the Hot 100. The album's closer "Someday" (a loose cover of Donny Hathaway's "Someday We'll All Be Free") featured

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their next work, Gap Band VI brought them back to #1 R&B in 1985, but the album sold fewer copies and did not go gold. "Beep a Freak" hit #2 R&B, "I Found My Baby" peaked at #8 on the R&B charts, and "Disrespect" peaked at #18. That year, lead singer Charlie Wilson and singer Shirley Murdock provided backing vocals on

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Isley Brothers are an American musical group originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, that started as a vocal trio consisting of brothers O'Kelly Isley Jr., Rudolph Isley and Ronald Isley in the 1950s. With a career spanning over seven decades, the group has been cited as having enjoyed one of the "longest, most influential, and most diverse careers in the pantheon of popular music".
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with a fourth brother, Vernon, the group performed gospel music until Vernon's death a few years after its formation. After moving to the New York City area in the late 1950s, the group had their first successes during these early years, first coming to prominence in 1959 with their fourth single, "Shout", written by the three brothers. Initially a modest charted single, the song eventually sold over a million copies. In the 1960s, the group recorded songs for a variety of labels, including the top 20 single "Twist and Shout" and the Motown single "This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)", before recording and issuing the Grammy Award-winning hit "It's Your Thing" on their own label, T-Neck Records.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Influenced by gospel and doo-wop music, the group began experimenting with different musical styles incorporating elements of rock and funk as well as pop balladry. The inclusion of younger brothers Ernie Isley (lead guitar, drums) and Marvin Isley (bass guitar), and Rudolph's brother-in-law Chris Jasper (keyboards, synthesizers), in 1973 turned the original vocal trio into a complete band and reached the height of their success. For the next full decade, they recorded a string of top-selling albums from 3 + 3 to Between the Sheets, including the number one album The Heat Is On.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The six-member band splintered in 1983, with Ernie, Marvin, and Chris Jasper forming the short-lived spinoff group Isley-Jasper-Isley. The oldest member, O'Kelly, died in 1986 and Rudolph and Ronald released a pair of albums as a duo before Rudolph retired to a life in the Christian ministry in 1989. Ronald reconvened the group two years later in 1991 with Ernie and Marvin; five years later, in 1996, Marvin Isley left the group due to complications of diabetes. The remaining duo of Ronald and Ernie achieved mainstream success with the albums Mission to Please (1996), Eternal (2001) and Body Kiss (2003). Eternal spawned the top twenty hit "Contagious". As of 2019, the Isley Brothers continue to perform under the lineup of Ronald and Ernie.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Isley Brothers have sold over 18 million units in the United States alone. They have had several hit songs including four Top 10 singles on the United States Billboard chart. With their first major hit charting in 1959 ("Shout"), and their last one in 2001 ("Contagious"), they are among the few groups ever to have hit the Billboard Hot 100 with new music in five different decades. Sixteen of their albums charted in the Top 40 and thirteen of those albums have been certified gold, platinum or multi-platinum by the RIAA. The brothers have been honored by several musical institutions, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which inducted them in 1992. Five years later, they were added to Hollywood's Rockwalk, and in 2003 they were inducted to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. They received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The O'Jays are an American R&B group from Canton, Ohio, formed in 1958 and originally consisting of Eddie Levert (born June 16, 1942), Walter Lee Williams (born August 25, 1943), William Powell (January 20, 1942 – May 26, 1977), Bobby Massey (born 1942, Canton) and Bill Isles (January 4, 1941 – March 28, 2019). The O'Jays made their first chart appearance with the minor hit "Lonely Drifter" in 1963, but reached their greatest level of success once Gamble & Huff, a team of producers and songwriters, signed them to their Philadelphia International label in 1972. With Gamble & Huff, the O'Jays (now a trio after the departure of Isles and Massey) emerged at the forefront of Philadelphia soul with "Back Stabbers" (1972), and topped the US Billboard Hot 100 the following year with "Love Train." Several other US R&B hits followed, and The O'Jays were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004, and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005, and in 2013 they were inducted into National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pharcyde (pronounced "far side") is an American alternative hip hop group, formed in 1989, from South Central Los Angeles. The original four members of the group are Imani (Emandu Wilcox), Slimkid3 (Trevant Hardson), Bootie Brown (Romye Robinson), and Fatlip (Derrick Stewart). DJ Mark Luv was the group's first disc jockey (DJ), followed by producer J-Swift and then J Dilla.[citation needed] The group is perhaps best known for the hit singles "Drop", "Passin' Me By" and "Runnin'", as well as their first album, Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde (1992). The group continues to tour and record, both collaboratively and in solo projects—the most recent being Hardson's collaborative EP with the award-winning DJ Nu-Mark (of Jurassic 5) released in 2014 on Delicious Vinyl.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pointer Sisters are an American R&B singing group from Oakland, California that achieved mainstream success during the 1970s and 1980s. Spanning over four decades, their repertoire has included such diverse genres as pop, disco, jazz, electronic music, bebop, blues, soul, funk, dance, country and rock. The Pointer Sisters have won three Grammy Awards and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994. The group had 13 US top 20 hits between 1973 and 1985.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group had its origins when sisters June and Bonnie Pointer began performing in clubs in 1969 as 'Pointers, a Pair'. The line-up grew to a trio when sister Anita joined them. They got a record deal with Atlantic Records and released several unsuccessful singles. The trio grew to a quartet when sister Ruth joined in December 1972. They then signed with Blue Thumb Records, recorded their debut album, and began seeing more success, winning a Grammy Award in 1975 for Best Country Vocal Performance for "Fairytale" (1974). Bonnie left the group in 1978 to commence a solo career with modest success.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group achieved its greatest commercial success as a trio during the 1980s consisting of the line-up of June, Ruth, and Anita, winning two more Grammys for the top 10 hits "Jump (For My Love)" (1984) and "Automatic" (1984). The group's other U.S. top 10 hits are "Fire" (1979), "He's So Shy" (1980), "Slow Hand" (1981), the remixed version of "I'm So Excited" (1984) and "Neutron Dance" (1985).
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;June Pointer, the youngest sister, struggled with drug addiction for much of her career, leaving the group in April 2004 prior to her death from cancer in April 2006, at the age of 52. She was replaced by Ruth's daughter Issa Pointer. This trio had a number two hit in Belgium in 2005, covering "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves" with Belgian singer Natalia. Between 2009 and 2015, the group consisted of Anita, Ruth, Issa, and Ruth's granddaughter Sadako Pointer. While all four women remained in the group, they most often performed as a trio rotating the lineup as needed. In 2015, Anita was forced to retire due to ill health, leaving Ruth the sole member of the original sibling line-up.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 2016, Billboard magazine ranked them as the 80th most successful dance artists of all-time. In December 2017, Billboard magazine ranked them as the 93rd most successful Hot 100 Artist of all-time and as the 32nd most successful Hot 100 Women Artist of all-time.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. As a diverging act to the popular pop rock of the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, heavier-driven sound that came to define hard rock. The band's first stable line-up consisted of bandleader Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica, keyboards), Mick Jagger (lead vocals, harmonica), Keith Richards (guitar, vocals), Bill Wyman (bass guitar), Charlie Watts (drums), and Ian Stewart (piano), the last of whom was removed from the official line-up in 1963, but continued to work with the band as a contracted musician until his death in 1985. The band's primary songwriters, the partnership of Jagger and Richards, assumed leadership after Andrew Loog Oldham became the group's manager. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by Mick Taylor, who in turn left in 1974 and was replaced in 1975 by Ronnie Wood, who has since remained. Since Wyman's departure in 1993, Darryl Jones has served as bassist. The Stones have not had an official keyboardist since Stewart's departure in 1963, but have employed several musicians in that role, including Jack Nitzsche (1965–71), Nicky Hopkins (1967–82), Billy Preston (1971–81), Ian McLagan (1978–81), and Chuck Leavell (1982–present).
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rooted in blues and early rock and roll, the Rolling Stones started out playing covers and established themselves at the forefront of the British Invasion of bands that became popular in the United States in 1964, also being identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. The band found more success with their own material; songs such as "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" and "Paint It Black" became international hits, and Aftermath (1966) – their first entirely original album – has been considered the most important of the band's formative records.[2] After a short period of experimentation with psychedelic rock in the mid-1960s, the Stones returned to their 'bluesy' roots with Beggars Banquet (1968), Let It Bleed (1969), Sticky Fingers (1971) and Exile on Main St. (1972). In 1969 they were first introduced on stage as 'The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World'.

On June 30, 1976, they received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2015, they were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Music critic Robert Christgau has called the Spinners "a renowned show group whose supersmooth producer inhibits improvisation".

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sugarhill Gang is an American hip hop trio. Their 1979 hit "Rapper's Delight" was the first rap single to become a Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.

			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members, all from Englewood, New Jersey, consisted of Michael "Wonder Mike" Wright, Henry "Big Bank Hank" Jackson, and Guy "Master Gee" O'Brien. The three were assembled into a group by producer Sylvia Robinson, who founded Sugar Hill Records with her husband, record producer Joe Robinson. The group and the record company were named after the Sugar Hill, Harlem, neighborhood.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their 1979 hit "Rapper's Delight" was the first rap single to become a Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. The group never had another U.S. hit, though it had multiple European hits, such as "Apache", "8th Wonder" (which was performed on the American music show Soul Train in 1981), "Rapper's Reprise (Jam Jam)", and "Showdown" (with the Furious Five). The trio wound down over the next five years and disbanded in 1985.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Temptations are an American vocal group who released a series of successful singles and albums with Motown Records during the 1960s and 1970s. The group's work with producer Norman Whitfield, beginning with the Top 10 hit single "Cloud Nine" in October 1968, pioneered psychedelic soul, and was significant in the evolution of R&B and soul music. The band members are known for their choreography, distinct harmonies, and dress style. Having sold tens of millions of albums, the Temptations are among the most successful groups in popular music.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Featuring five male vocalists and dancers (save for brief periods with fewer or more members), the group formed in 1960 in Detroit, Michigan, under the name The Elgins. The founding members came from two rival Detroit vocal groups: Otis Williams, Elbridge "Al" Bryant, and Melvin Franklin of Otis Williams & the Distants, and Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams of the Primes. In 1964, Bryant was replaced by David Ruffin, who was the lead vocalist on a number of the group's biggest hits, including "My Girl" (1964), "Ain't Too Proud to Beg" (1966), and "I Wish It Would Rain" (1967). Ruffin was replaced in 1968 by Dennis Edwards, with whom the group continued to record hit records such as "Cloud Nine" (1969) and "Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)" (1970). The group's lineup has changed frequently since the departures of Kendricks and Paul Williams from the act in 1971. Later members of the group have included singers such as Richard Street, Damon Harris, Ron Tyson, and Ali-Ollie Woodson, with whom the group scored a late-period hit in 1984 with "Treat Her Like a Lady".
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of their career, the Temptations released four Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles and fourteen R&B number-one singles. Their music has earned three Grammy Awards. The Temptations were the first Motown recording act to win a Grammy Award – for "Cloud Nine" in 1969s – and in 2013 received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Six of the Temptations (Edwards, Franklin, Kendricks, Ruffin, Otis Williams and Paul Williams) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. Three classic Temptations songs, "My Girl", "Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)", and "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone", are among The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. The Temptations were ranked at number 68 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of all time.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of 2020, the Temptations continue to perform with founder Otis Williams in the lineup (Williams owns the rights to the Temptations name).

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trammps are an American disco and soul band, who were based in Philadelphia and were one of the first disco bands.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The band's first major success was with their 1972 cover version of "Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart". The first disco track they released was "Love Epidemic" in 1973. However, they are best known for their Grammy winning song, "Disco Inferno", originally released in 1976, becoming a UK pop hit and US R&B hit. After inclusion in the

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wiz is a 1978 American musical adventure fantasy film produced by Universal Pictures and Motown Productions and released by Universal Pictures on October 24, 1978. A reimagining of L. Frank Baum's classic 1900 children's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz featuring an all-black cast, the film was loosely adapted from the 1974 Broadway musical of the same name. It follows the adventures of Dorothy, a shy, twenty-four-year-old Harlem schoolteacher who finds herself magically transported to the urban fantasy Land of Oz, which resembles a dream version of New York City. Befriended by a Scarecrow, a Tin Man, and a Cowardly Lion, she travels through the city to seek an audience with the mysterious Wiz, who they say is the only one powerful enough to send her home.
			<br><br>

			<a href="#" onclick="toggle_visibility('ma-the-wiz');toggle_visibility('ma-quincy-jones');">
				<b><p2>Quincy Jones</p2></b>
			</a> supervised the adaptation of Charlie Smalls and Luther Vandross' songs for it. A handful of new songs, written by Jones and the songwriting team of Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson, were added for it.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon its original theatrical release, the film was a critical and commercial failure, and marked the end of the resurgence of African-American films that began with the blaxploitation movement of the early 1970s. Despite its initial failure, it became a cult classic among black audiences, Jackson's fanbase, and Oz enthusiasts. Certain aspects influenced The Wiz Live!, a live television adaptation of the musical, aired on NBC in 2015.
